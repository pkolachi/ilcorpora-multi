as the planet acquired to stay ina single line,different energy are formed
when it got equilibrium with the planet ,Compounds with different density  centralize in one place
When they acquire the mass of exist as a planet, the compounds having different density are concentrated in different centers.
Thus, an avalanche results. The total energy does not change in this process, but because of the law of entropy, avalanches only happen in one direction and that is towards the ""ground state"" — the state with the largest number of ways in which the available energy could be distributed.

Sun light gets the freedom to travel out side the photosphere to space, so like this in this form the energy spreads to outside the sun.
Outside of this photosphere, sunlight get the freedom to propagate towards the space.  Thus the energy comes out of the sun and spread outside.
Outside the photosphere the sunlight can travel towards the space, thus the energy spreads out from the sun in this form.
The power production by fusion in the core varies with distance from the solar center. At the center of the Sun, theoretical models estimate it to be approximately 276.5 watts/m3,[39] a power production density that more nearly approximates reptile metabolism than a thermonuclear bomb.[note 2] Peak power production in the Sun has been compared to the volumetric heats generated in an active compost heap. The tremendous power output of the Sun is not due to its high power per volume, but instead due to its large size.

The Rayleigh scattering coefficient for a group of scattering particles is the number of particles per unit volume N times the cross-section. As with all wave effects, for incoherent scattering the scattered powers add arithmetically, while for coherent scattering, such as if the particles are very near each other, the fields add arithmetically and the sum must be squared to obtain the total scattered power.
This damage can result in permanent impairment of vision, up to and including blindness.Since the retina has no sensitivity to pain, and the effects of retinal damage may not appear for hours, so there is no warning that injury is occurring.

the nuclear fusion is the process of the magnet related to density,temperature,because of this,the balancing of the nuclear fusion inside the core takes place.a small increase in the rate of nuclear fusion will increase the temperature of the core and this results in the small expansion of India and unbalancing.the small decrease in the rate of nuclear fusion leads to the compression of the core and brings back to the original form.
Nuclear fusion process is deeply related to density and temperature, so that the nuclear fusion happened in core acquire self equilibrium:if the rate of nuclear fusion is slightly increases, core become more hot and caused to expand opposite to the weight exerted by outer layer. This will reduce the fusion rate and rectify the non equilibrium; if the rate of fusion is slightly reduced, it causes to reduce the temperature and will leads to the contraction of core. This will increase the fusion rate and core developed and returned to the old stage.
Atomic fusion process is closely connected with concentration and temperature, because of this the atomic fusion happening in the axis reaches itself a  equilibrium. If the atomic fusion rate is increased little bit axis gets heated more and expands against the weight given by outer layers.  This will result in reduction of rate of combination and rectifies in-equilibrium, if the rate of  combination is reduced temperature is reduced and results in the contraction of axis and this will increase the rate of combination and the axis expands and reaches to the old stage.
Temperature is a physical property of matter that quantitatively expresses the common notions of hot and cold. Objects of low temperature are cold, while various degrees of higher temperatures are referred to as warm or hot. Quantitatively, temperature is measured with thermometers, which may be calibrated to a variety of temperature scales.

When we look from the   southern  pole we can see that the pole star in     the atmosphere in a lower position and when we look from the  northern pole it is in a higher position.This leads him to the conclusion that the earth is round.
when look from southern region polar star is little down and when from northern region it is little up,this prove that the earth is round.
He got into the assumption that Earth is round. Because when looked from Southern Greece the polar star is seen lower in the atmosphere and when looked form Northern pole it was seen high.
he came to a conclusion that the earth is spherical shape from the observations that the polar star is in the lower atmosphere when looking from southern Grease and it is in the upper atmosphere when looking from north pole.

Retina can be damaged by looking directly into sun for a long time, ( around 100 second) especially when the ultra violet rays from sun are more intensive.Young peoples and man made lens have got more tendency to allow ultra violet rays, so when sun is at its highest level or  near to that level retina have got more chance to get damaged
By looking the sun with naked eyes for a long period ( for about 10 seconds), especially when the ultra violet rays are severe, through falling of ultra violet retina get wounded.  The yonug ones and man made may allow more ultra violet rays when sun is in the highest place or near to that the possibility of getting wound to retina is more.
Looking at the sun with naked eye for a long time (about 100 seconds) especially during peak hours of the day when the emission of the ultraviolet rays are more, and it affects the retina. The chances are more to get damage the retina especially for the eyes of children and those who use man made lenses because they allow the ultraviolet to pass thorough during the peak hours.
If you look at Sun with eyes unprotected for a long period ( about 100 seconds), especially when the sun rays are strong , the U V rays hurts the retina. Because the eyes of youngsters and man made lenses get through the U V rays easily, When the Sun is in peak or near about the chances of retina getting hurt is more.

in the sun rise and sun setting time the sun rays have to travel a lot in the earths atmosphere due to this sunlight become  weak.(Rayleigh scattering and Mie Scattering) at that time sun is so dim so that we can watch it with bare eye.(not at the time when sun comes from the cloud)
its hue is intermediate between blue and green[3]. Conversely, glancing toward the sun, the colors that were not scattered away—the longer wavelengths such as red and yellow light—are visible, giving the sun itself a slightly yellowish hue. Viewed from outer space, instead, the sky is black and the sun is white.
During sunrise and sunset we can watch sun  with naked eyes  due to Rayleigh scattering and Mie scattering sun will appear blurred. (except at times when sun come out of the cloud suddenly)

Radiation given out by sun is from some of its inner portion's heat energy source was inferred by Earnest Rutherford on those days, he has also of the opinion that that source was prone for radio activity.
Earnest ruther ford guessed that the rays send out by the sun is from some heat energy resourse , and expressed his openion that this resourse will be radio active..
By applying the ionization theory developed by Indian physicist Megh Nad Saha she was able to accurately relate the spectral classes of stars to their actual temperatures. She showed that the great variation in stellar absorption lines was due to differing amounts of ionization that occurred
In those days ,according to Rutherford,the rays given out by sun was from the interior source ,which was radioactive.

Higher heat through atomic fusion  is produced only at the axis, the rest portion of sun are heated by the heat flown from axis.
thermal energy is created due to atomic reaction in kabhil. the rest of the sun area is out side the kabh so it is heated.
Only the core of the sun produces large amount of heat by nuclear fission.  The remaining parts of the sun are heated by the heat conducted from the core.
only cam pa becomes heat by this way , other parts become hot by the heat from cam pa

the sphere above this layer is having lower temperature  and not absorbing much light.with that we can see the surface of the sun with the naked eyes.
The layer above it has an atmosphere which has a low temperature and which does not absorb greatly,that is why we can see the outter layer, when looked with bare eyes.
This is simply the layer above which the gases are too cool or too thin to radiate a significant amount of light, and is therefore the surface most readily visible to the naked eye.
this gas surface is comparatively  less hot and it does not receive the light in a big scale, is above this layer, so when seen with our naked eyes it is seen as much bigger than sun's surface.

This is because of to determine the accurate position of the planets, helps to describe the motion of its past and future and the deviation of gravitational force of attraction between them.
as the position of the planets are correctly known,the future motion of those can be calculated.
It can be explained the movements in future by predicting Gravitational changes
It was helped to describe the movement of previous and past time by learning the differences of gravity by the ability to take measurement of the exact position of planets.
Using that, the movements of  the  celestial objects,  which are    attracting mutually due to gravity , can  measure it more accurately with the help of mathematics.
because of the additional degrees of freedom—for example, a baseball can spin while it is moving. However, the results for point particles can be used to study such objects by treating them as composite objects, made up of a large number of interacting point particles. The center of mass of a composite object behaves like a point particle.
using that it is possible to predict the movement of mutually interacted celestial bodies due to gravitation  more accurately with the help of mathematics.
Using this, the movement of spherical bodies that are acting in each other due the gravitational force of attraction was able to predict easily with the help of mathematics.

the number of families in nature is increasing and the disease from them is spread to their children and die easily.when they die their dna will disappear.
As  the species are always multiplying beyond the source of nature  only those organisms best adapted to existing conditions are able to survive and reproduce and the unfavorable  adaptations  will disappear.
since the species reproduces beyond the resources of nature, the suitable species only sustains the characteristic variations and such variations are transfered to its offspring and the unfavorable characteristic variations destroy and their variations disappear.
As species always breed beyond available resources, favourable variations would make organism better at surviving and passing the variations on to their offspring, while unfavourable variations would be lost.

The Kaldayans had invented the fact that eclipse is happening according to a continuous revolution called saros.
The present overall density of the universe is very low, roughly 9.9 × 10−30 grams per cubic centimetre. This mass-energy appears to consist of 73% dark energy, 23% cold dark matter and 4% ordinary matter. Thus the density of atoms is on the order of a single hydrogen atom for every four cubic meters of volume

Since this process requires four protons, in each section 3.7 nos (6.2Kg) protons (Hydrogen atom centers)are converted to Helium atom centers. (It is calculated that about 8.9 free protons are there in the sun)
in this reaction 4 protons are needed in every second 3.7 number (6.2 kilogram)protons (or hydrogen molecules) helium molecular reaction take place ( around 8.9 protons are created in sun)
This process needs 4 peratones. So in each second 3.7 (6.2 kilogram) peratones (or Hydrogen nuclei) are convenved to Helium nuclei.(The sun contains about 8.9 trillion peratons)
in each second 3.7 protons reacts . it is believed that protons are there in sun

Due to the eyes cabaility of adjusting itself to the improper difference in visions,eye balls will be developed  according to the reduction of total light in vision.there fore it is dangerous to look directly in to sun on partial solar eclipse
Eyes will not get adjusted with high extra ordinary scene differences, since due to total reduction of quantity of light the pupil expands so that the it is dangerous to look directly at the partial lunar eclipse
It is dangerous to look at even partial solar eclipse because the eyes immediately accommodate and adjust to the seeing environment, for this phenomena when the amount of light decreases  the pupil of enlarges.
Eyes which can not adjust immediately to the unusually higher sight variation, the quantity of  total light of eyes reduces and the eye ball will expand. Therefore, it will harm viewing partial sun eclipse also.

It is supposed that Some people became wealthy who were doing agriculture in certain area and some others failed in the agriculture caused to unit the people amd they selected their leader and gave him power to rule.
People started associations they wished to unite as they were divided as athyagraham comes into the minds of people as only people who did agriculture in a particular place got benefits whereas the other people did not get anything.And it is believed that they might have a elected a person and made them the leaders.
When a group of people who were living in a particular region were developed by doing agriculature and the people of other region could not develop lack of agriculture, this may caused to create fight among each other. Then they thought of living jointly and for which they were in need of a leader like a person to hand over the power.
It is believed that the fights which occurred due to avarice which originated from the fact that those who did agriculture in a separate land prospered and those in other groups did not get the same, may have prompted the people to unite and for that purpose may have selected a leader or someone else and gave power.

The people who supported this theory beleived that the part of the earth which formed as moon when got separated from earth formed the basin of Pacific ocean. If  Fission Hypothesis is true in the beginning earth spin rapidly.
pacific ocean is formed when moon began to split away and there formed a deep excavation. if nuclear fission was correct earths first time rotation at first stages will be faster
The supporters of this argument are believe that the Pacific  sea is created by this separation of the earth. If the Fission hypothesis is true the movement of the earth is very fast at its early stages.
it is considered that the hole made on the surface of the earth due to the flying away of the part considered as moon is pacific ocean.if the fission hypothesis is correct,the speed of rotation of the earth was more earlier.

The Sun is about halfway through its main-sequence evolution, during which nuclear fusion reactions in its core fuse hydrogen into helium. Each second, more than four million metric tons of matter are converted into energy within the Sun's core, producing neutrinos and solar radiation. At this rate, the Sun has so far converted around 100 Earth-masses of matter into energy. The Sun will spend a total of approximately 10 billion years as a main sequence star

the neutrons are also emitted due to the nuclear fusion,but unlike photons they change into liquid amazingly.because of this most of them will get escaped from sun.it is observed that the number of neutrons emitted by the sun is only 1/3rd of which is calculated by theoretical way.
Neutrinos are produced due to nuclear fusion but unlike photons its seen only rarely reacted to the matter so that the whole amount will escape from sun abruptly. The number of Neutrinos produced in the sun is one third that of theoretically calculated
As a result of atomic fusion neutrons are also produced, but different from photon they rarely react with matter so that the all of them escapes from the sun and comes out. It has been assessed that for a few years the number of neutrons as estimated to be produced actually is one third less than calculated theoretically.
In the previous section temperature was defined in terms of the zeroth law of thermodynamics. It is also possible to define temperature in terms of the second law of thermodynamics which deals with entropy. Entropy is a measure of the disorder in a system. The second law states that any process will result in either no change or a net increase in the entropy of the universe. This can be understood in terms of probability.

TCP/IP was developed before OSI model, and for the same reason the layers on this protocol does not join with OSI models fully.There are 5 layers on this.Physical layer, Data Link layer, Network Layer, Transport layer and Application layer. The joining of Session, Presentation and application in OSI model is of same like in Application layer of TCP/IP
OSI models are developed after TCP  developed . So this type items are not joining with OSI models. 5 Layer are there. Physical Layer, Data Link Layer,Network Layer, Transport Layer and Transport Layer etc. The Layers; session, presentation, application are same in OSI and TCP/IP
TCP has been developed before OSA.  So that the layers in this protocol do not completely join with the layers of OSA model.  There are five layers in this.  Physical layer, Data link layer, net work layer, transport layer, application layer etc.Session, presentation, application such layers of OSA model combination is equal to layer of TCP/IP application.

Unluckily according to that result sun can only give heat upto 2 crores of years but the   geological studies reports that minimum30 crores of years is the result.
Unfortunately according to the results show that the sun will emenate heat only for 2 million years, accoridng to the astronomical studies of that time show that it is at least 30 million years
Unfortunately total amount of energy available via this mechanism only allowed for the Sun to shine for millions of years rather than the billions of years that the geological and biological evidence suggested for the age of the Earth.
