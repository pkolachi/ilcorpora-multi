If I were a Jew born in Germany , I would have been living in Germany and would have considered Germany as my mother country . Even if a fellow German would have threatened to kill me or imprison me in the darkest jail , I would never give in to accepting something which in my opinion is not right.This is why I will wait for my Jewish brothers to join me in my stand against the wrongful things.I am , in fact , confident that everyone will regard me as a model , and follow my actions.If one or all Jews accept the method stated here , their living conditions will not deteriorate more than they have till now.If they succeed in tolerating the pain given to them , they will attain internal power and happiness . This will be the first revolt against the actions of Hitler , who has indulged in manslaughter and planned violence.If the minds of the Jews learn to tolerate pain voluntarily , the day of death will also transform into a Thanksgiving Day or a joyous day.Just like Jihova gave his whole tribe in the hands of a tyrant .

This is even today politically debatable , as Pakistani-American historian Ayesha Jalal gives the logic that Gandhi and Congress were not willing to share power with Muslim League .

No ruler till date has been so evil as Hitler has been.No crimes can be justified by citing religious principles of declaring a higher race among people , which will be accepted and credited now and in the future.It is clear that insanity of a young leader can not justify horrific crimes against an entire race.No such crimes can be said as a lawful war of Germany in the name of humanity.But I do not beleive in any kind of war.It is beyond my ability to discuss the benefit and losses of war.If we can not confront Germany and stop it from committing such crimes , then we must stop any alliances with Germany .

It is not like I can give my answer to this difficult question without any scruples . My sympathy is with the Jews . I know them closely from the time I was in South Africa , and some of them have become my friends for life . I came to know about the long persecution through these friends only . They have been kept as untouchables in Jews religion . But my sympathy will not take me away from reason . Dfivision of a nation for the Jews does not appeal to me . Is sanction there in the Bible and on what basis are they asking for Philippine in return ? Why do they , who love other people in the world , not make home in the country where they are born and where they are earning a livelihood ?

Whatever is happening today in Palestine can not be proved right from any perspective of customs and good practices .
