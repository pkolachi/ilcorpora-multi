In 1933 , persecution of the Jews became active Nazi policy , but at first laws were not as rigorously obeyed or as devastating as in later years . Such clauses , known as Aryan paragraphs , had been postulated previously by antisemites and enacted in many private organizations.On April 1 , 1933 , Jewish doctors , shops , lawyers and stores were boycotted . Only six days later , the Law for the Restoration of the Professional Civil Service was passed , banning Jews from being employed in government . This law meant that Jews were now indirectly and directly dissuaded or banned from privileged and upper-level positions reserved for “ Aryan ” Germans . From then on , Jews were forced to work at more menial positions , beneath non-Jews.On August 25 , 1933 , the Haavara Agreement was signed , which allowed 60,000 German Jews to emigrate to Palestine by 1939.On August 2 , 1934 , President Paul von Hindenburg died . No new president was appointed ; instead the powers of the chancellor and president were combined into the office of Führer . This , and a tame government with no opposition parties , allowed Adolf Hitler totalitarian control of law-making . The army also swore an oath of loyalty personally to Hitler , giving him power over the military ; this position allowed him to easily create more pressure on the Jews than ever before
