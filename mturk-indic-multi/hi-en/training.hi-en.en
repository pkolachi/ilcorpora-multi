Another point of controversy is how to anticipate how much the emerging economies like India and China to lessen their emissions. According to the report of Hall, the gross national Co2 emissions of China may be greater that America, but china has said that per capita emissions are less than America by 5 times and because of that these restrictions should not be imposed on it.India has also repeated this fact,which had been exempted from Kyoto restriction, and which is the largest source of industrial emissions. However the U.S contends that if they must bear the cost of reducing emissions, then China should do the same.
.Amother issue of the debate is what can be expected from emerging economies like India and China regarding the levels to which they will reduce their emissions.

India also has echoed this argument, and it is exempted from implementing the Kyoto regulations and it is big source of industrial emissions.  However, the U.S. contends that if they must bear the cost of reducing emissions, then China should do the same.

Wireless phones are such phones which instead of a wired instrument use one or more radio handsets. This instrument connects to a base station without a wire which in turn connects to a traditional land line to make a call. As against a mobile phones, the wireless phone use private base stations (which is of a land line subscriber), and which is not distributed.
It is a wire less phones are which those use one are more radio head sets inside of wires this connect with one base station.
The wireless phone is this type of phone which use one or more than one radio  handset in palace of one wire handset.this handset connect base station without wire,which is connect to traditional landlines for calling.In opposite to mobile phone wireless is used to private base  station(which is the customer of landlines),which is not distribute.
.Wireless phones are such phone which does not have wires conected to each other phones but it has small radio handsets. these are interconnected by mean of waves with the help of radio stations.Its technology is different from Mobiles.
.Mobile phone consumers per 100 residents during 1997-2007. The most used data facility is SMS written messsages, of which 74% of the mobile phone users are active users(towards the end of 2007, more than 2.4 billion out o f a a total of 3.3 billion). In the fiscal year 2007, the value of written messages was more than 100 billion dollars and based on the total number of mobile phone users, the number of messages per day per person was 2.6 SMS (Source Informa 2007). In UK, in 1992, the first SMS written message was sent from a computer to a mobile phone, whereas in 1993, in Finland, the first person to person phone to phone SMS was sent.

The idea of adding text messaging to the services of mobile users was latent in many communities of mobile communication services at the beginning of the 1980s. The first action plan of the CEPT Group GSM, approved in December 1982, requested ""The services and facilities offered in the public switched telephone networks and public data networks... should be available in the mobile system"".[4] This target includes the exchange of text messages either directly between mobile stations, or transmitted via Message Handling Systems widely in use since the beginning of the 1980s.[5]The SMS concept was developed in the Franco-German GSM cooperation in 1984 by Friedhelm Hillebrand and Bernard Ghillebaert.[6] The innovation in SMS is Short. The GSM is optimized for telephony, since this was identified as its main application. The key idea for SMS was to use this telephony-optimized system, and to transport messages on the signaling paths needed to control the telephony traffic during time periods when no signaling traffic existed. In this way, unused resources in the system could be used to transport messages at minimal cost. However, it was necessary to limit the length of the messages to 128 bytes (later improved to 140 bytes, or 160 seven-bit characters) so that the messages could fit into the existing signaling formats.This concept allowed SMS to be implemented in every mobile station by updating its software. This concept was instrumental for the implementation of SMS in every mobile station ever produced and in every network from early days. Hence, a large base of SMS capable terminals and networks existed when the users began to utilize the SMS.[7] A new network element required was a specialized short message service center, and enhancements were required to the radio capacity and network transport infrastructure to accommodate growing SMS traffic.
Short Message Service (SMS) is the text communication service component of phone, web or mobile communication systems, using standardized communications protocols that allow the exchange of short text messages between fixed line or mobile phone devices. SMS text messaging is the most widely used data application in the world, with 2.4 billion active users, or 74% of all mobile phone subscribers.[citation needed] The term SMS is used as a synonym for all types of short text messaging as well as the user activity itself in many parts of the world.SMS as used on modern handsets was originated from radio telegraphy in radio memo pagers using standardized phone protocols and later defined as part of the Global System for Mobile Communications (GSM) series of standards in 1985[1] as a means of sending messages of up to 160 characters[2], to and from GSM mobile handsets.[3] Since then, support for the service has expanded to include other mobile technologies such as ANSI CDMA networks and Digital AMPS, as well as satellite and landline networks.[citation needed] Most SMS messages are mobile-to-mobile text messages though the standard supports other types of broadcast messaging as well.

In 1944, specific plans for the proposed DoD were put forth by the Army, the Navy, and the Joint Chiefs of Staff. In a special message to Congress on 19 December 1945, President Harry Truman proposed creation of a unified department of state defense. A proposal went to Congress in April 1946, but was held up by the Naval Affairs Committee hearings in July 1946, which raised objections to the concentration of power in a single department. Truman eventually sent new legislation to Congress in February 1947, where it was debated and amended for several months.DoD was created in 1947 as a national military establishment with a single secretary as its head to preside over the former Department of War (founded in 1789) and Department of the Navy (founded in 1798; formerly the Board of Admiralty, founded in 1780). The Department of the Air Force was also created as a new service (previously under the War Department as the Army Air Forces). DoD was created in order to reduce interservice rivalry, which was believed to have reduced military effectiveness during World War II.

The Department of the Air Force was also created as a new service (previously under the War Department as the Army Air Forces). DoD was created in order to reduce interservice rivalry, which was believed to have reduced military effectiveness during World War II.On July 26, 1947, Truman signed the National Security Act of 1947, which set up the ""National Military Establishment"" to begin operations on September 18, the day after the Senate confirmed James V. Forrestal as the first Secretary of Defense. The Establishment had the unfortunate abbreviation ""NME"" (with a pronunciation virtually identical to ""enemy""), and was renamed the ""Department of Defense"" (also described in the Act under ""Title II - The Department of Defense"", and later abbreviated as ""DoD"") on August 10, 1949.

As with ""terrorism"" the concept of ""state terrorism"" is controversial.[92] The Chairman of the United Nations Counter-Terrorism Committee has stated that the Committee was conscious of 12 international Conventions on the subject, and none of them referred to State terrorism, which was not an international legal concept. If States abused their power, they should be judged against international conventions dealing with war crimes, international human rights and international humanitarian law.[93] Former United Nations Secretary-General Kofi Annan has said that it is ""time to set aside debates on so-called 'state terrorism'. The use of force by states is already thoroughly regulated under international law""[94] However, he also made clear that, ""regardless of the differences between governments on the question of definition of terrorism, what is clear and what we can all agree on is any deliberate attack on innocent civilians, regardless of one's cause, is unacceptable and fits into the definition of terrorism.State terrorism has been used to refer to terrorist acts by governmental agents or forces. This involves the use of state resources employed by a state's foreign policies, such as using its military to directly perform acts of terrorism. Professor of Political Science Michael Stohl cites the examples that include Germany’s bombing of London and the U.S. atomic destruction of Hiroshima during World War II. He argues that “the use of terror tactics is common in international relations and the state has been and remains a more likely employer of terrorism within the international system than insurgents.""

.This power is also subject to review by the Court but the obligation to prove the misuse of this power or malafides is on the person who is challenging it after promulgaion of ordinance ending the Parliament is also in good custom because necessity for ordinance is immediate whereas Parlianment takes time to pass any statute We can consider the ordinance a temporary legislation which is under the Constitutional powers of the President but also the Government can do it with the advice of the Council of Ministers if the parliament rejects any ordinance any time, even after its expiration the actions taken within the period of validity are not considered unconstitutional.
This power is examined by the judiciary and it should not be used for misuse.It is used when the parliament takes more than enough time given to take the decision.
This power is re-imposed by court but miss-use of this authority will be with the person who challenged it. The purpose behind the order might be of discontinuation of term, because order is required immediately while ministry is taking time for passing any ordinance. Regulations can be for infinite time that can be under purview of president. They works as per instructions of ministry council. If parliament rejects any ordinance then that become discontinued henceforth but the work done under it till time are not be void.
This power is also subject to review by the court, but the misfortune of misusing the power will rest on that person who in order to face this challenge issue the ordinance, can get the Parliament session prorogued in view of the emergency to take steps as the Parliament will take time to deliberate. Ordinance comes under the statutory powers of the President though he goes by the advice of the Union Cabinet Ministers and when if the Parliament doses not approve any Ordinance then it will be a loss, but under the rules any steps taken as per the Ordinance will not be unconstitutional.

.In the incipient Jurassic time (approximately 180 crore years back)when the increase in the greenhouse gases happened, averrage temperature increased to 5 degrees C (9 degrees F).  Indications from the research of the Open University are that due to warming weathering of the rocks increased about 400 percent.  This weathering makes a bond of calcite and dolomite forms of carbon, level of CO2 in the next 150000 years came to average level.
Starting Jurassic period (near about 180 million years before), temperature was increased by 5 degree C(9 degree F), because of increasing in green house gasses. After some research by Open University they got some clues, that because of warming rate of stone weathering is increased by 400 present, this way weathering bounds to the carbon with calcite and dolomite. The level of CO2 in return in normal level after next 150000 years.
In the early Jurassic period(almost 180 crore years back), increase of green house gases lead an increase of around 5 degree C in the temperature. Studies of Open University tells that due to warming weathering of rocks increased by 500%. Like this weathering binds carbon to calcite and dolomite. It took 150000 years for carbon to reacch its normal level.
In the early Jurassic period(around 180 years ago)temperatures increased 5 degrees on an average, due to increase in the greenhouse gases released.

For ""Cricket"" word, the word count is believed as a source. In the earliest known reference to the sport in 1598, it is called creckett. It met between Middle-age business connection, south-est England and county of flanders, which supposed to be Duchy of Burgundy. This name supposed to be derived from Krik(-e) of Middle Dutch or in old English Kris or Krise which means stick (Baisakhi in Hindi). That sounds like Old French word Criquet which means a kind of stick or club. In Samuel johnson's directory, he described cricket as ""cryce"" which means Saskon-A Stick. One more probable evidence is middle dutch word krickstoel which means - a long beneath stul which is used in church for resting knee, that looks like old age long two wicket and stumps. Bonn University's europian language expert Heiner gillmeister believes that Cricket is derived for middle dutch Hockey - met de (krik ket)sen means along with back side of stick.
In 1598,[9] a court case referred to a sport called creckett being played by boys at the Royal Grammar School, Guildford around 1550. This is the sport's earliest definite mention. It is believed that it was originally a children's game but references around 1610[17] indicate that adults had started playing it and the earliest reference to inter-parish or village cricket occurs soon afterwards. In 1624, a player called Jasper Vinall was killed when he was struck on the head during a match between two parish teams in Sussex.[18] The first English touring team on board ship at Liverpool in 1859During the 17th century, numerous references indicate the growth of cricket in the south-east of England. By the end of the century, it had become an organised activity being played for high stakes and it is believed that the first professionals appeared in the years following the Restoration in 1660. A newspaper report survives of ""a great cricket match"" with eleven players a side that was played for high stakes in Sussex in 1697 and this is the earliest known reference to a cricket match of such importance.The game underwent major development in the 18th century and became the national sport of England. Betting played a major part in that development with rich patrons forming their own ""select XIs"". Cricket was prominent in London as early as 1707 and large crowds flocked to matches on the Artillery Ground in Finsbury. The single wicket form of the sport attracted huge crowds and wagers to match. Bowling evolved around 1760 when bowlers began to pitch the ball instead of rolling or skimming it towards the batsman. This caused a revolution in bat design because, to deal with the bouncing ball, it was necessary to introduce the modern straight bat in place of the old ""hockey stick"" shape. The Hambledon Club was founded in the 1760s and, for the next 20 years until the formation of MCC and the opening of Lord's Old Ground in 1787, Hambledon was both the game's greatest club and its focal point. MCC quickly became the sport's premier club and the custodian of the Laws of Cricket. New Laws introduced in the latter part of the 18th century included the three stump wicket and leg before wicket (lbw).
A number of words are thought to be possible sources for the term ""cricket"". In the earliest known reference to the sport in 1598 (see below), it is called creckett. The name may have been derived from the Middle Dutch krick(-e), meaning a stick; or the Old English cricc or cryce meaning a crutch or staff.[2] Another possible source is the Middle Dutch word krickstoel, meaning a long low stool used for kneeling in church and which resembled the long low wicket with two stumps used in early cricket.According to Heiner Gillmeister, a European language expert of Bonn University, ""cricket"" derives from the Middle Dutch met de (krik ket)sen (i.e., ""with the stick chase""), which also suggests a Dutch connection in the game's origin. It is more likely that the terminology of cricket was based on words in use in south east England at the time and, given trade connections with the County of Flanders, especially in the 15th century when it belonged to the Duchy of Burgundy, many Middle Dutch[3] words found their way into southern English dialects
West, East Flemish and Zealandic, was spoken in the modern region of West and East Flanders and Zeeland and also in the Département du Nord of what is now France but was then part of the County of Flanders ;Brabantian was the language of the area covered by the modern Dutch province of North Brabant and the south of Gelderland; and the Belgian provinces of Flemish Brabant and Antwerp as well as the Brussels capital region;Hollandic was mainly used in the present provinces of North and South Holland and parts of Utrecht;Limburgish, spoken by the people in the provinces of modern Dutch and Belgian Limburg;Low Saxon, spoken in the area of the modern provinces of Gelderland, Overijssel, Drenthe and parts of Groningen.The last two of the Middle Dutch dialect groups mentioned above gradated into, respectively, Middle High German and Middle Low German, since these two areas border directly onto the German language-area in the narrow sense (i.e. that area where today German is the standard language). There was a dialect continuum, which was even more fluid than it is today.

The United States Department of Defense (USDOD, DOD or DoD, initially briefly referred to as the National Military Establishment or NME) is the U.S. federal department charged with coordinating and supervising all agencies and functions of the government relating directly to national security and the United States armed forces. The Department of Defense is an evolution of the Department of War. The organization and functions of the DoD are set forth in Title 10 of the United States Code.
Performance of Contract Administration Services (CAS) within DoD has been studied and modified for many years. In the early 1960’s, a study was commissioned by the Secretary of Defense to examine the entire DoD contracting process. Known as “Project 60,” the findings pointed to numerous benefits to consolidating contract administration functions. At that time, each agency and military service was performing their own contract administration which resulted in a great amount of duplicate effort. Many of the contract administration responsibilities were eventually moved to the Defense Logistics Agency (DLA). However, the military services continued to retain oversight of the major acquisition programs.
In 1944, specific plans for the proposed DoD were put forth by the Army, the Navy, and the Joint Chiefs of Staff. In a special message to Congress on 19 December 1945, President Harry Truman proposed creation of a unified department of state defense. A proposal went to Congress in April 1946, but was held up by the Naval Affairs Committee hearings in July 1946, which raised objections to the concentration of power in a single department. Truman eventually sent new legislation to Congress in February 1947, where it was debated and amended for several months.

State terrorism has been used to refer to terrorist acts by governmental agents or forces. This involves the use of state resources employed by a state's foreign policies, such as using its military to directly perform acts of terrorism. Professor of Political Science Michael Stohl cites the examples that include Germany’s bombing of London and the U.S. atomic destruction of Hiroshima during World War II. He argues that “the use of terror tactics is common in international relations and the state has been and remains a more likely employer of terrorism within the international system than insurgents."" They also cite the First strike option as an example of the ""terror of coercive diplomacy"" as a form of this, which holds the world hostage with the implied threat of using nuclear weapons in ""crisis management.""

Sun's activity will also be an effect that it will be warm stratosphere, the Green House gas theory predicts there is cooling. This trend has been observed since 1960 from the stratosphere is cooling. stratosphere ozone reduction also arises due to the coldness, the ozone depletion is not the end of the 1970s. Solar variation and volcanic activity due to the industrial age has not increased from 1950 until hot but cooling has happened. Peter Afokal and the United States in 2006, germany and other researchers in Switzerland found that the brightness of the sun has not changed from the last 1000 years. Solar cycles last 30 years caused the increase of only 0.07 percent. The very small contribution to global warming and the effect to.
One of the influence of sun's activity would be that stratosphere would become warm, whereas greenhouse gas theory forecasts it to become cold. Post 1960, this trend has been observed that stratosphere has only become cold.Reduction of stratospheric ozone leads to coolness, but ozone depletion did not happen till the decade of 1970. Due to solar variation and volcanic activities from industrial age till 1950, it did not become hot but has become cooler only. In 2006, Peter Foukal and other astrophysicists from USA, Germany and Switzerland found that in the last 1000 years there has been no net increase in sun's brightness. Due to solar cycle, in the last 30 years there is increase of only 0.07 %. For global warming effect this is a small but important contribution.
Another effect of solar processes is that the stratosphere gets warmer, whereas the greenhouse gas theory predicts a cooling there.  The tendency towards becoming cooler only is seen in the stratosphere after 1960.  Due to reduction of stratospheric ozone, cooling can also be the result, but depletion of ozone did not happen till the end of the decade 1970.  From the industrial age to 1950, temperature has not increased due to solar diversity and volcanic processes, on the contrary cooling has happened.  In 2006, Peter Foukal and other researchers of United States of America, Germany and Switzerland have foound that since the last 1000 years there is no net increase in the sun's brightness.  Because of the solar cycle, there is just o.o7 percent increase in the last 30 years.  This is a very small but significant contributor to global warming.
In sun one effect is also their in that stratosphere become hot,in that green house gas theory tells the future .it shows that from the 1960 stratosphere become cool.

There has been an increase in atmospheric temperature from 0.74 +/- 0.18 (1.33+/- 0.32 deg F) from past 100 years till 2005.The Intergovernmental panel on Climate Change has come to a conclusion that the cause of the rising temperatures in the past 100 years is the increase in amounts of the anthropogenic grrenhouse gases.

In 1988, in school during a Harris Shield match with friend Vinod Kambli; Sachin played a historic 664 runs unbeaten partnership.
In 1598, a court case filed in 1550's by students of Royal Grammar School, Guildford enlighten. This is oldest case of this game. This seems that it was children game but around 1610, adult started to play this game and just after that Inter perish village Cricket played. In 1624, one of the player-Jasper Vinall dead during match between two teams in susex of perish, he had head injury.
A number of other words have been suggested as sources for the term ""cricket"". In the earliest definite reference to the sport in 1598,[9] it is called creckett. Given the strong medieval trade connections between south-east England and the County of Flanders when the latter belonged to the Duchy of Burgundy, the name may have been derived from the Middle Dutch[10] krick(-e), meaning a stick (crook); or the Old English cricc or cryce meaning a crutch or staff.[11] In Old French, the word criquet seems to have meant a kind of club or stick.[12] In Samuel Johnson's Dictionary, he derived cricket from ""cryce, Saxon, a stick"".[13] Another possible source is the Middle Dutch word krickstoel, meaning a long low stool used for kneeling in church and which resembled the long low wicket with two stumps used in early cricket.[14] According to Heiner Gillmeister, a European language expert of Bonn University, ""cricket"" derives from the Middle Dutch phrase for hockey, met de (krik ket)sen (i.e., ""with the stick chase"").[15] Dr Gillmeister believes that not only the name but the sport itself is of Flemish origin.[16]
Despite many prior suggested references, the first definite reference to the game is found in a 1598 court case concerning dispute over a school's ownership of a plot of land. A 59-year old coroner, John Derrick, testified that he and his school friends had played creckett on the site fifty years earlier. The school was the Royal Grammar School, Guildford, and Mr Derrick's account proves beyond reasonable doubt that the game was being played in Surrey c.1550.[5]The first reference to it being played as an adult sport was in 1611, when two men in Sussex were prosecuted for playing cricket on Sunday instead of going to church.[6] In the same year, a dictionary defines cricket as a boys' game and this suggests that adult participation was a recent development.
Gambling introduced the first patrons because some of the gamblers decided to strengthen their bets by forming their own teams and it is believed the first ""county teams"" were formed in the aftermath of the Restoration in 1660, especially as members of the nobility were employing ""local experts"" from village cricket as the earliest professionals.[5] The first known game in which the teams use county names is in 1709 but there can be little doubt that these sort of fixtures were being arranged long before that. The match in 1697 was probably Sussex versus another county.The most notable of the early patrons were a group of aristocrats and businessmen who were active from about 1725, which is the time that press coverage became more regular, perhaps as a result of the patrons' influence. These men included the 2nd Duke of Richmond, Sir William Gage, Alan Brodrick and Edward Stead. For the first time, the press mentions individual players like Thomas Waymark.

According to first century Greek ambassador Dio Chrysostom, the South Indians possess sacred texts which include 1 lakh shlokas, which shows that the Mahabharata, even during the first century had 1 lakh shlokas.
First century Greek ambassador Dio Chrystom pointed out that South-Indians had a manuscript which consisted of 1 lakh (100,000) shlokas. It can be deduced that Mahabharat even in first century BC consisted on 1 lakh shlokhas.
Dio Chrysostom, a royal messenger in the first century Iran, says that south Indians have a book containing more than a million verses, which proves that the Mahabharat in the first century contained more than a million verses.
At the first century of Yunnan dio Chrysostom is told that south India has 1lakh slokas book.
From all these complete realities one can understand that Mahabharat was written 3000 years BC or approximately 1000 to 1900 BC that is written by renowned scholars ,lanlanguage translations,and the british texts and olden religons.
It has been proved that 3000 years prior to isha around 1900-1000.it has been explained in mahabharata.
From these findings we can assume Mahabharth was written in B.C.3000 or in between 2900 -2000.This date are assumed by considering astrological dates, by the analysis of language and archeological evidences.

The late 4th millennium date has a precedent in the calculation of the Kaliyuga epoch, based on planetary conjunctions, by Aryabhata (6th century). His date of February 18 3102 BCE has become widespread in Indian tradition (for example, the Aihole inscription of Pulikeshi II, dated to Saka 556 = 634 CE, claims that 3735 years have elapsed since the Bharata battle.[26]) Another traditional school of astronomers and historians, represented by Vriddha-Garga, Varahamihira (author of the Brhatsamhita) and Kalhana (author of the Rajatarangini), place the Bharata war 653 years after the Kaliyuga epoch, corresponding to 2449 BC
All the great emperor of Chaurky reign Pulikeshi 2 century records address shows Mahabharat battle was passed in 3th 734. According to this point of view Mahabharat battle is held before 3100 BC
According to  Emperor Pulkasi of Chalukya Dynasty (2-5 AD) - Mahabharat war was fought 3735 years ago so it will come aroud 3100 BC

Some other possible effects are the increase in sea levels during 1990 to 2100, repercussions to agriculture, possible slowing of the thermohaline circulation, depletion of ozone layer, intensity increases in hurricanes and extreme weather events (but this will happen after some time), lowering of pH of oceans, spreading of deceases like malaria and dengue fever.  According to the forecast of one study, till 2050,  18% to 35% animal and plant species will get extinct, this is based on a model of 1103 animals and plants, but only very few automated models have predicted extinction of life because of atmospheric changes, and it is also clear that the possibility of extinction is uncertain.
Some more related effect are Oceans 1990 to 2100 an increase in size, repercussions to agriculture, slowing of thermohaline circulation, ozone layer depletion and hurricanes and extreme weather events will increase substantially(but will come after long time), drop in pH level of Oceans and spreading of disease like malaria and dengue fever. According to a research's prediction till 2050 17% to 35% animals and plants species will become extinct, this work is based on a sample 1103's animals and plants species, only some well equipped researches have calculated the effect of environmental change on extinction of living things and one research tells us that extinction cannot be predicted.
Some implication between 1900-2100 are considered to be repercussions to agriculture, thermohaline, possible slowing of thermohaline circulation, depletion of ozone layer, hurricanes and extreme weather events with increased intensity (which will occur at a later stage), pH lowering, higher incidences of tropical diseases such as malaria and dengue. One study predicts that by 2050 18%-35% animal and plant kingdom will be extinct, which is based on 1103 animal and plant species, but some researchers especially one study is uncertain of the extinction phenomenon due to climate change.

When any person does not obey the directions and instructions of the court or neglects them, it is called civil contempt, but if the person defames the court, defamation of judges or tries to argue with them, it is called criminal contempt, for which imprisonment and penalty, both have to be awarded.  For civil contempt, imprisonment is not possible. This power in India is very infamous and debatable.
It is a civil contempt if a person does not follow orders but it a person humiliates the court and the judges then it becomes a criminal contempt and for which he may face jail/fine or both. There is not provision for imprisonment in civil contempt which is quite notorious and infamous in India.
When a person breaks a notice or law its taken to civil court but if a person defames court or judges its treated as criminal type and considered in criminal court. In criminal court punishment is given in teh form of jail for a certian period but in civil jail provision is not applicable

During 17th century, many references of cricket popularity in East England. This became prestigious event later. It is said that after restoration of 1660, professionals were came in front. In 1697, this game played at very high bet in sussex which itself a ""Big Cricket Match"" where 11 players played, this report was published in newspaper. This was a first news of such kind.
During the 17th century, numerous references indicate the growth of cricket in the south-east of England. By the end of the century, it had become an organised activity being played for high stakes and it is believed that the first professionals appeared in the years following the Restoration in 1660. A newspaper report survives of ""a great cricket match"" with eleven players a side that was played for high stakes in Sussex in 1697 and this is the earliest known reference to a cricket match of such importance.
Gambling introduced the first patrons because some of the gamblers decided to strengthen their bets by forming their own teams and it is believed the first ""county teams"" were formed in the aftermath of the Restoration in 1660, especially as members of the nobility were employing ""local experts"" from village cricket as the earliest professionals.[5] The first known game in which the teams use county names is in 1709 but there can be little doubt that these sort of fixtures were being arranged long before that. The match in 1697 was probably Sussex versus another county.The most notable of the early patrons were a group of aristocrats and businessmen who were active from about 1725, which is the time that press coverage became more regular, perhaps as a result of the patrons' influence. These men included the 2nd Duke of Richmond, Sir William Gage, Alan Brodrick and Edward Stead. For the first time, the press mentions individual players like Thomas Waymark.
Cricket certainly thrived after the Restoration in 1660 and is believed to have first attracted gamblers making large bets at this time. In 1664, the ""Cavalier"" Parliament passed the Gaming Act 1664 which limited stakes to £100, although that was still a fortune at the time,[1] equivalent to about £12 thousand in present day terms [7]. Cricket had certainly become a significant gambling sport by the end of the 17th century. There is a newspaper report of a ""great match"" played in Sussex in 1697 which was 11-a-side and played for high stakes of 50 guineas a side.[6]With freedom of the press having been granted in 1696, cricket for the first time could be reported in the newspapers. But it was a long time before the newspaper industry adapted sufficiently to provide frequent, let alone comprehensive, coverage of the game. During the first half of the 18th century, press reports tended to focus on the betting rather than on the play

Many mobile and satellite transceiver units support the sending and receiving of SMS using an extended version of the Hayes command set, a specific command language originally developed for the Hayes Smartmodem 300-baud modem in 1977.[citation needed]The connection between the terminal equipment and the transceiver can be realized with a serial cable (e.g. USB), a Bluetooth link, an infrared link, etc. Common AT commands include AT+CMGS (send message), AT+CMSS (send message from storage), AT+CMGL (list messages) and AT+CMGR (read message).[35]However, not all modern devices support receiving of messages if the message storage (for instance the device's internal memory) is not accessible using AT commands.
SMS is used for M2M (Machine to Machine) communication. For instance, there is an LED display machine controlled by SMS, and some vehicle tracking companies use SMS for their data transport or telemetry needs. SMS usage for these purposes is slowly being superseded by GPRS services due to their lower overall cost[citation needed]. GPRS is offered by smaller telco players as a route of sending SMS text to reduce the cost of SMS texting internationally.

Many importance are given to cellular phones ,in that mobile phone involved in cells and continued conversation in this bus station and telephone two powers are involved.
Cellular technology boom was necessary, including handover, there was scope to continue the dialogue between the cells in the mobile phone. The system variable transmission power in both base stations and telephone (including base stations controlled by) , which vary in range and cell size made it possible. When the system came close to expanding capacity, reducing power transmission capacity made it possible to connect to the new cells, resulting in more, smaller cells and thus more capacity. The increasing evidence of just too many old, tall cell site towers can be seen on the top of the towers which had no antenna. The site also originally created large cells, and hence their antenna on top of high towers were straight; Tower were designed in such a way so that the system be expanded - can shrink the size of cells - their original mast antenna can be reduced to reduce the limit.

Scientific and medical community's current consensus view is that it is impossible that cellular phones or base stations cause health effects.
As nobile phones pelt electromagnetic rays, when they are used for a long time, concerns were raised about the risk of cancer.  These rays are harmless, but localised heat can be generated.  The conclusive opinion of the scientifica and medical community is that the effect on health because of cellular phones or base stations is inpossible.
Because mobile phone transmits the electro magnetic waves, if it is used for vary long time then there is danger of having cancer, this wave is atomic, can cause local heat. Scientist and Medical Association given a joint advice, that cellular phone and base station can't affect health.
Because there radiation emission from mobile phone, when you use it for a prolonged duration concerns have been raised for cancer risk, but this one view, but there could be location rise in temperature, the scientific and medical community hold the view that base station can never be a health hazard.

Sex position is the important part of sex. All the efforts give result at this point. Sex positions are important since ancient times. Vatsayan had also written a lot about them and many new things have been known from China. Western countries have done a lot new work on this. In India Mughals gave a new dimension to sex positions. Now days new innovations in sex positions have made them even more joyful. All these boil down to five major categories. These are-
Sex position is the most important part of the sex act. All results of the efforts start from sex position. The importance of sex posisition exists since historical era.The vatsiyan have given a lot of input, the Chinese have also added so have the Mid West countries. In India, the Moguls have given given the sex positions a new face to it. After a lot of research and discoveries they have emerged in various different shades. In the historical, as well as modern study we can conclude that the sex positions can be broadly classified into 5 parts. In these-

This called front UN explained way four more terrorist involved some terrorist behavior,like which think less about some places.
philosophers have expressed different views: while, according to David Rodin, utilitarian philosophers can (in theory) conceive of cases in which the evil of terrorism is outweighed by the good which could not be achieved in a less morally costly way, in practice the ""harmful effects of undermining the convention of non-combatant immunity is thought to outweigh the goods that may be achieved by particular acts of terrorism"".[46] Among the non-utilitarian philosophers, Michael Walzer argued that terrorism can be morally justified in only one specific case: when ""a nation or community faces the extreme threat of complete destruction and the only way it can preserve itself is by intentionally targeting non-combatants, then it is morally entitled to do so
Terrorists have different model, some work on killing innocent people , some do very insulting work,
batsmen are out and team has made 224 runs then it is called as they made 224 runs with a loss of 5 wickets( it is simply: written as 5 for 224 and 224/5 form, by Australia, 224 for 5 and 5/224).
The score of a team is the number of runs that its players score, as well as the number of wickets it has lost. For example, if the players have scored 224 runs and lost 5 wickets, the score is denoted by 224 for 5, or written as 224/5. or Australia is 5 for 224 or 5/224.
Score of the team is displayed as total runs and players which are out, for example, if five batsman are out and team made 224 run then it is called as they made 225 runs loosing 5 wickets (normally shown in the form of 224/5, Australia, 224 / 5)
The score of a team is shown by the number of runs it made and the number of batsmen who are out. For example, if five batsmen are out and team has made 224 runs, then it is said that they have made 224 runs for the loss of 4 wickets (this is usually written as  224 for 4 and 224/4, in Australia, 4 for 224 and 4/224).

Point source is considered as most effective problem solution as it uses simple mathamitical logics and last for long period. In 1900 Doping was introduced as per Gaussian and predicted isopleths and turbulence
point  problems are considered to be the best ones because they involve the study of simple mathematics for a long period of time. Year 1900 has been given for back dating.
Point source problem is considered most important because long duration study of simple mathematics has been incorporated in this. Regarding reverse dating has 1900. For Gaussian dispersion model air pollution forecasting considered with isopleths (a solution for air turbulence). This sample has been validated on large scale and absorbed with experimental data of all conditional scenario.
Point source problem is understood the best because this combines sinple mathematical study with a long term projection.  For counter-dating, in the year 1900, Gaussian model of dispersion was made for predicting gaseous pollution with the help of isopleths(atmospheric turbulences of one type).  This model is widely accepted and it can use the experimental data for predicting all types of atmospheric conditions.
James Hansen and his assistants proposed that the by-products of burning fossil fuels - CO2 and aerosols, cancel out each others effects and therefore atmospheric warming is mostly due to other greenhouse gases other than CO2.
Hansen (James Hansen) and his colleague proposed that things produced by fossil fuel burn-CO2 and aerosol finishes other effects, therefore warming almost forms due to Non-CO2 green house gases.
James Hansen and his co-operators kept a proposal, The elements which are emitted from burning of fossil fuel - CO2 and aerosols are ended each others effect. That's why maximum heat occurs from other CO2 green house gasses.
James Hansen and his aides have put forth a finding that organisms eliminate the effects of carbon dioxide and aerosols, hence the heating is caused due to non-carbon dioxide greenhouse gases.

Scorers are directed by umpires hand signals, for example umpire raises index finger to indicate that batsman is out; and if batsman scores six runs then he raises both of his hands
along with score umpire like example umpire lifts his index finger and then the batsman is out and if the bats man made six runs then he lifts his bothe hand
Scorers work according to hand signals made by the umpires. If the umpire shows his index finger, it means that he player is out.If he raise both hands in the air, it means that the player has scored six runs.
The scorers are acknowledged by umpire's arm signal. For example if a batsman is out then the umpire signals by pointing his one finger upright, and if the batsman hits 6 run then the umpire signals by uprighting both his hands in air.

This is similar to horse riding position.Here women get more support from men while doing the act.She fold the leg and directly sits on the penis of the men.here women can get support from men,men can hold women waist while having sex.man should force and support women to make this position better as women jumps straight on the tip of penis to insert her vagina directly.
This position is very similar to the horse-rider position. It differs just a little from the horse-rider position. In this the woman gets a little more support from the man. In the horse-rider position coitus supported by the knees on legs spread parallel to the bed appears a little stable, but for young and energetic people this has been changed a little and the Asian horse-rider position has been created. In this the woman makes her legs lengthwise of the bed and brings the vagina over the penis by bending at the knees. To attain this position the man should lie straight on his back and the woman should stand with her feet next to his buttocks. Then she should try to sit by bending at the knees. At the end the Asian horse-rider position will be attained. Though the woman requires more effort during coitus in this position, but the man can make this position spectacular by supporting the woman's buttocks with his hands.
This is approximately the same position as the horse riding position.  With a small difference this is separated from the horse riding position.  In this the woman gets some more support from the man.  In the horse riding position, on the legs spread parallel to the cot, intercourse with the strength of the knees looks stable, but for young and active persons, a small modification is made and Asian horse riding position is made.  In this the lady keeps her legs perpendicular to the cot and folding her knees brings her cunt right above the phallus.  To get into this position, man lies down on his back and the woman connects her feet with his pelvis and stands up and then from the knees turning her legs tries to sit down, by this Asian horse riding position is made.  However in this position the effort of the lady in intercourse is more but the man can give support to the pelvis of the lady with his hands and can make this position splendid.
this is very closely related to horse riding positionits little differnt from horse riding here women gets more sport than gents in horseriding way

This seems that Quran was descended especially for Arabian but whenever you reach to the place where one can feel as if this sentence is especially for special time or country, then stay for a while and think or note the things and then you think about it then you will realise that people from all decade and from every land place is same and on them same thing is applicable which was applicable to Arabian from that time.
Apparently it feels that the Quran has been created for the Arabs of that time only, but whenever you reach a place where it is felt that these words were meant for a particular time or a particular country, if you stop there to ponder over it or take a note and later on deliberate on it, you will feel that human beings of all the time and of all the places are all alike and for them these words are equally applicable as they were for the Arabs of that time.
Overall, it can be understood that the Quran originated for the ancient Arabs for a certain period of time, but if we ever think of the Quran being only for a particular era or country, we will realise that man is universal everywhere and need the principles of the Quran as much as the ancient Arabs did.
By common sense you may think that that compassion was only for those Arabs who lived in that country then at that special particular point of time, but if you think with a sober mind you will find out that what those Arabs experience then is applicable to any human being living at any place on this earth and living in any particular point of time and further you will have the same experience those Arabs had then.

Measures of air pollutant emissions are those representative measures which tell us the extent of the pollutant spread in the air by the process related to the emission of that pollutant.  These measures are usually expressed in terms of weight measurement, volume, distance or as the total quantity of the pollutant emitted divided by the pollutants emitted per unit of the concerned process (like the micro particulates emitted per megagram of coal burnt).  Measures of this type make it easy to measure the emissions from different sources of the air pollution.  In most cases, these measures are averages of the available data on the quality indicator chosen, and usually long term averages.
Air pollutants are representative standard for component of emission which tells the quantity of emitted pollutants in air by the activity related to emission of that pollutant. These components are generally expressed by quantity of pollutants, distance or expressed by dividing duration of pollutant activity with an unit of pollutant (like micro emission per megagram of coal). This type of component help in assessing emitted emission from different sources of air pollution. In maximum cases, these components are average of available data acceptable quality, and normally considered long duration period.
Air pollution is the introduction of chemicals, particulate matter, or biological materials that cause harm or discomfort to humans or other living organisms, or damages the natural environment into the atmosphere.The atmosphere is a complex dynamic natural gaseous system that is essential to support life on planet Earth. Stratospheric ozone depletion due to air pollution has long been recognized as a threat to human health as well as to the Earth's ecosystems.Indoor air pollution and urban air quality are listed as two of the world's worst pollution problems in the 2008 Blacksmith Institute World's Worst Polluted Places report.Pollutants can be classified as either primary or secondary. Usually, primary pollutants are substances directly emitted from a process, such as ash from a volcanic eruption, the carbon monoxide gas from a motor vehicle exhaust or sulfur dioxide released from factories.Secondary pollutants are not emitted directly. Rather, they form in the air when primary pollutants react or interact. An important example of a secondary pollutant is ground level ozone — one of the many secondary pollutants that make up photochemical smog.
Air polluted production like generally it comes from the polluted related expanded air in this way air comes in different ways.

There are different kinds of pitches, hence there is variation in the amount of bounce, spin and speed experienced by the bowler. It is easy to face balls on a hard pitch because the bounce is higher but uniform.A dry pitch is bad for the batsman since the cracks in it help a spinner to get a good spin.Wet pitches or green pitches(ones covered in grass)help a fast bowler to get extra bounce.This kind of pitch may aid a fast bowler during the start of a match, but as the match proceeds, it is advantageous to the batsman.
Pitch conditions can be different, due to which the bowler can get different bounce, spin and speed. It is easy to bat on hard pitch because the ball gets high but even bounce on it. Dry pitch is considered bad for batting because cracks emerge on this type of pitch and in these conditions the spinner can play an important part. Moist pitch or pitch having grass cover, which is called green pitch, helps fast bowler to get extra bounce. This type of pitch helps fast bowler through out the match. However, as the match progresses this type of pitch becomes better for batting.
The ""condition"" of the pitch has a significant bearing on the match  and this determines the bounce,spin and direction of the bowler.it is easy to bat in solid pitch as the bounce of the ball is predictable.But dry pitch is not suitable for batting as the spinner can determine the pace of the game.Green Pitches are good for fast bowling and bounces.Even thought these types of pitches are helpful for bowlers as the match progresses this allow batsman to  play well.
The stability of the pitch can vary and because of this the bounce, spin and pace obtained to the bowler may vary. In a hard pitch it is easy to bat since the bounce on this pitch may be high but same. Dry pitch is considered as bad for the batsman since cracks are formed in these and when it happens so spinner can play a good role, wet pitch or grass filled pitch( which is called as green pitch)helps good fast bowlers to get more bounce,these type of pitches help the bowlers during the entire period of the match, but as the match progresses it becomes more and more better for batting.
If any batsman leaves the batting (in general because of injury) and he doesn't return back then he is actually ""not out"" and his exit is not considered a out, but he is abandoned because his inning gets over. Extra batsman is not permitted to bat.
If a batsman ""retires"" (usually due to injury) and cannot return, he is actually ""not out"" and his retirement does not count as a dismissal, though in effect he has been dismissed because his innings is over. Substitute batsmen are not allowed.
If, any batsman leaves the ground (normally because of injured) and can't return then in reality he is ""not out"", his leaving of ground is not considered as out, but he get dismissed because inning is finished. Re-established batsman have not the permission.
If a batsman leaves the ground (commonly on the ground of injury) and can't return, in practice he remains ""not out"" and his coming out is not treated as out, rather he is suspended as his innings is finished. Permission for substitute batsman is not there.

Usually, in the matches with 2 innings at least 6 hours playing time is given. Limited over matches finish in 6 hours or more. Other than informal brief intervals for drinks, usually, for tea and lunch there are formal intervals. Between the innings there is a short interval too. Historically, a form of cricket which was known as single wicket, was very successful and in the 18th and 19th century events, it was given the status of main cricket. In this form, though there were 1 to 6 players in each team, and at one time there was only one batsman, he had to play every ball until the end of his innings. After the beginning of Limited Over Cricket, Single Wicket Cricket was rarely played

One of the forms of cricket is known by the name Single wicket, was very successful in 18th and 19th centuries, was tagged as the major type of cricket, though each team had 1 to 6 players, but at a time only one batsman would be there, he had to face all the balls till the end of his innings, after the introduction of limited overs cricket, Single wicket cricket is played rarely.

This game had made leading growth in 18th century and that became national game of England. Bet played leading role in that and rich fans prepared 11 players team. In 1707 Cricket was very famous in London and a huge crowd gathered in Artillery Ground of finsbury. Single Wicket game had attracted most of the people. Bowling started in 1760 where bowlers started to pitch the ball instead of full toss. To play bounce ball, tremendous design revolution came in bats. The old hockey type sticks formed more flatter. Hambledon Club formed in 1760, next 20 years upto which MCC established and in 1787 lord's old ground... (Incomplete sentence)
The game underwent major development in the 18th century and became the national sport of England. Betting played a major part in that development with rich patrons forming their own ""select XIs"". Cricket was prominent in London as early as 1707 and large crowds flocked to matches on the Artillery Ground in Finsbury. The single wicket form of the sport attracted huge crowds and wagers to match. Bowling evolved around 1760 when bowlers began to pitch the ball instead of rolling or skimming it towards the batsman. This caused a revolution in bat design because, to deal with the bouncing ball, it was necessary to introduce the modern straight bat in place of the old ""hockey stick"" shape. The Hambledon Club was founded in the 1760s and, for the next 20 years until the formation of MCC and the opening of Lord's Old Ground in 1787, Hambledon was both the game's greatest club and its focal point. MCC quickly became the sport's premier club and the custodian of the Laws of Cricket. New Laws introduced in the latter part of the 18th century included the three stump wicket and leg before wicket (lbw).
The first famous clubs were London and Dartford in the early 18th century. London played its matches on the Artillery Ground, which still exists. Others followed, particularly Slindon in Sussex which was backed by the Duke of Richmond and featured the star player Richard Newland. There were other prominent clubs at Maidenhead, Hornchurch, Maidstone, Sevenoaks, Bromley, Addington, Hadlow and Chertsey.But far and away the most famous of the early clubs was Hambledon in Hampshire. It started as a parish organisation that first achieved prominence in 1756. The club itself was founded in the 1760s and was well patronised to the extent that it was the focal point of the game for about thirty years until the formation of MCC and the opening of Lord's Cricket Ground in 1787. Hambledon produced several outstanding players including the master batsman John Small and the first great fast bowler Thomas Brett. Their most notable opponent was the Chertsey and Surrey bowler Edward ""Lumpy"" Stevens, who is believed to have been the main proponent of the flighted delivery.It was in answer to the flighted, or pitched, delivery that the straight bat was introduced. The old ""hockey stick"" style of bat was only really effective against the ball being trundled or skimmed along the ground.
Although many ""traditional"" cricket fans objected to the shorter form of the game, limited overs cricket did have the advantage of delivering a result to spectators within a single day; it did improve cricket's appeal to younger or busier people; and it did prove commercially successful.The first limited overs international match took place at Melbourne Cricket Ground in 1971 as a time-filler after a Test match had been abandoned because of heavy rain on the opening days. It was tried simply as an experiment and to give the players some exercise, but turned out to be immensely popular. Limited overs internationals (LOIs or ODIs, after One-day Internationals) have since grown to become a massively popular form of the game, especially for busy people who want to be able to see a whole match. The International Cricket Council reacted to this development by organising the first Cricket World Cup in England in 1975, with all the Test playing nations taking part.
No one can claim to be unsuccessful after hard work and sacrifices. If that person loses something in this world, that person becomes a heir to immortality and achieves a lot of other things.

The only possibility of a result being undeclared is when the match ends in a ""tie"", or the match having being stopped due to bad weather.Each team plays a single innings and faces a limited number of overs.Generally the overs are set for 40 or 50. In a 20-20 match, each team plays just for 20 overs. During the Hobart Limited Overs International Match
Mannerly, sometimes match is played on the other day if there is bad day or has been abandoned. The main reason of limited over match is to produce results and thats why a occasional draw is not possible, but most of the time result cannot be declared as the match tie or has to be abandoned due to bad weather. Each tem plays only one innings and a limited number of overs. Mostly, the limit is 40 or 50 overs. In Twenty20 cricket, each team plays only 20 overs. During Hobart limted overs International
Practically, on some occasions a match continues to the next if it gets stopped or is suspended due to bad weather conditions. The main objective of limited overs match is to yield result and as such there cannot be any traditional draw; but sometimes the result cannot be declared when the score becomes a tie or  the match is suspended midway due to adverse weather conditions. Each team plays only one innings  and faces only a limited number of overs. Commonly the limits is either 40 or 50. In Twenty20 Cricket each team faces only twenty overs.

The GAO is also interested in ways DoD can partner with other government agencies to save money and create efficiencies. One way was through use of the Veterans Administration's Consolidated Mail Outpatient Pharmacy (CMOP) program. The CMOP fills continuation of therapy or refill prescriptions only. Initial prescriptions are written for veterans at one of the Veteran Administration’s health care facilities. When a refill is needed, the health care facilities process the prescriptions. The CMOP then uploads this information from multiple facilities in its region. Once filled, the United States Postal Service (USPS) delivers the prescriptions. The health care facility or clinic is notified of the prescription’s completion electronically. As of 2000, the annual workload was near 50 million prescriptions. Processing and filling prescriptions took two days; three more days were required for mail delivery.
In addition, the Secretary of Defense was given greater authority over three of the branches of the military (Army, Navy, and Air Force). Prior to the creation of the National Military Establishment/Department of Defense, the Armed Forces of the U.S. were separated into different cabinet-level departments without much central authority. The Marine Corps remained as a separate service under the Department of the Navy, and the Coast Guard is under Department of Homeland Security, ready to be shifted to the Navy Department during time of declared war (as it was in both world wars).
DoD policies and directives protect democracy by establishing strict limitations on the political activities of members of the military. For example, DoD Directive 1344.10 prohibits active duty military running for office or making political appearances in uniform.[19] However, enforcing this strict separation between the military and politics has been problematic. For example, over the years, many elected officials, including members of Congress continued serving in the reserves while holding elected office. As another example, at a September 14, 2007, rally for Republican Presidential candidate John McCain in New Hampshire, seven on-duty uniformed Army personnel addressed the gathering.[20] As another example, although DOD Directive 1344.10 prohibits political appearances by active duty military in uniform, Virginia Governor Bob McDonnell invited a uniformed Army Staff Sergeant to stand behind him during his televised Republican response to the 2010 State of the Union Address

In 1998, the first mobile business was tried in Finland, whem in Espo two Coca-Cola vending machines were involved in linkage with SMS sales. Gradually this idea spread nd in 1999, Philippines launched the first commercial mobile payment project on the mobile operator Globe and Smart. Today mobile payments are used very widely in Asia, Africa and selected European markets, in uses like starting from mobie banking, mobile credit card, to mobile business. For example, in Philippines it is not unusual that somebody's entire salary is paid to settle the mobile bill. In Kenya the limit for funds transfer from one mobile banking account to the other is 10 lakhs American dollars. In India, if the utilities bill is paid through the mobile, 5% discount is available. In Astonia, the Government caught people collecting parking fee in cash, which is a crime, therafter the government announced that for parking fee settlement, only mobile payment through SMS is valid, and today in Astonia, all the parking fee is controlled through mobile and in this process the crime has ended.
In 1998 Finland try the first mobile payment when Aspo two COCO-cola shelling machine was capable to payment by SMS.so the this thought is distributed and In 1999 Philipins start the mobile operator global and smart commercial mobile payment system.Today mobile payment is via mobile banking,mobile credit card these are use to vary largely in Asia,Africa and selected European market.for example In philipins is not common the hole salary in payment the mobile bill.In Kenya the the money transfer limit is 10 million American dollar via one mobile banking account to another account.In India get a 5% discount to payment the application bill via mobile.Government got the criminal to take the cash parking fee in Astoniya,So the government is declare the payment is via mobile is acceptable for parking and today the all parking fee is control by the mobile in Astoniya and for this process the crime is totally end.
first premium-rate media content delivered via the SMS system was the world's first paid downloadable ringing tones, as commercially launched by Saunalahti (later Jippii Group, now part of Elisa Group) in 1998. Initially only Nokia branded phones could handle them. By 2002 the ringtone business globally had exceeded one billion US dollars of service revenues, and nearly 5 billion dollars by 2008[citation needed].The Value-added service provider (VASP) providing the content submits the message to the mobile operator's SMSC(s) using a TCP/IP protocol such as the short message peer-to-peer protocol (SMPP) or the External Machine Interface (EMI). The SMSC delivers the text using the normal Mobile Terminated delivery procedure. The subscribers are charged extra for receiving this premium content; the revenue is typically divided between the mobile network operator and the VASP either through revenue share or a fixed transport fee. Submission to the SMSC is usually handled by a third party such as Itelebill, Zong or Daopay.
The first commercial deployment of a short message service center (SMSC) was by Aldiscon (now Acision) with Telia (now TeliaSonera) in Sweden in 1993[21], followed by Fleet Call (now Nextel)[citation needed] in the US, Telenor in Norway[citation needed] and BT Cellnet (now O2 UK)[citation needed] later in 1993. All first installations of SMS gateways were for network notifications sent to mobile phones, usually to inform of voice mail messages. The first commercially sold SMS service was offered to consumers, as a person-to-person text messaging service by Radiolinja (now part of Elisa) in Finland in 1993. It should be noted that most early GSM mobile phone handsets did not support the ability to send SMS text messages, and Nokia was the only handset manufacturer whose total GSM phone line in 1993 supported user-sending of SMS text messages.Initial growth was slow, with customers in 1995 sending on average only 0.4 messages per GSM customer per month.[22] One factor in the slow takeup of SMS was that operators were slow to set up charging systems, especially for prepaid subscribers, and eliminate billing fraud which was possible by changing SMSC settings on individual handsets to use the SMSCs of other operators

The thermal inertia of oceans and many slow movements of unseen effects meaning that, earths current temperature is not balanced with the force on her. After studying Climate commitment it seems that if green house gases are stabilized at the level of 2000 then after that till some extent
Thermal inertia Earth's oceans and slow response of many indirect effects of the Earth's present mean temperature of the pressure put on him is not in balance with studies of climate committment appears that if greenhouse gases 2000
As a consequence of the slow response to the thermal inertia of the thermal inertia of the great oceans of the earth and other invisible influences, the present temperature of the earth is not in balance with the pressure put on it.

The emission temperature of infrared radiation depends on the intensity, from the upper layers of the atmosphere longwave radiation is emitted, and from the lower layers, this is less.  Most of the radiation emitted from the upper layers goes into the space, whereas the radiation from the lower layers enters the atmosphere again and gets absorbed by it.  In this way, the green house effect depends on the rate of decrease of temperature with the height.  If the temperature decrease rate is less green house effect is less and vice versa.  Theories and models both indicate that due to the worming effect, the decrease in temperature as we go up is reduced.  A negative lapse rate feedback is produced and this makes the green house effect weak.  Calculation of the rate of change of temperature with height is very subtle and sensitive to tiny changes, and so it is very difficult to find out whether the model represents the reality or not.

Hambledon Club was biggest central club up to Lord's Old Ground formed. MCC become premier club for this game and that became authenticate body for Laws of Cricket. New rules formed in North hemisphere during 18th century where three stumps and Leg-before-wickets included.
The Hambledon Club was founded in the 1760s and, for the next 20 years until the formation of MCC and the opening of Lord's Old Ground in 1787, Hambledon was both the game's greatest club and its focal point. MCC quickly became the sport's premier club and the custodian of the Laws of Cricket. New Laws introduced in the latter part of the 18th century included the three stump wicket and leg before wicket (lbw).
But far and away the most famous of the early clubs was Hambledon in Hampshire. It started as a parish organisation that first achieved prominence in 1756. The club itself was founded in the 1760s and was well patronised to the extent that it was the focal point of the game for about thirty years until the formation of MCC and the opening of Lord's Cricket Ground in 1787. Hambledon produced several outstanding players including the master batsman John Small and the first great fast bowler Thomas Brett. Their most notable opponent was the Chertsey and Surrey bowler Edward ""Lumpy"" Stevens, who is believed to have been the main proponent of the flighted delivery.It was in answer to the flighted, or pitched, delivery that the straight bat was introduced. The old ""hockey stick"" style of bat was only really effective against the ball being trundled or skimmed along the ground.
In 1744, the Laws of Cricket were codified for the first time and then amended in 1774, when innovations such as lbw, middle stump and maximum bat width were added. These laws stated that the principals shall choose from amongst the gentlemen present two umpires who shall absolutely decide all disputes. The codes were drawn up by the so-called ""Star and Garter Club"" whose members ultimately founded MCC at Lord's in 1787. MCC immediately became the custodian of the Laws and has made periodic revisions and recodifications subsequently

In wartime, the Department of Defense has authority over the Coast Guard; in peacetime, that agency is under the control of the Department of Homeland Security (DHS). Prior to the creation of DHS, the Coast Guard was under the control of the Department of Transportation and earlier under the Department of the Treasury. According to the U.S. Code, the Coast Guard is at all times considered one of the five armed services of the United States. During times of declared war (or by Congressional direction), the Coast Guard operates as a part of the Navy; the service has not been under the auspices of Navy since World War II, but members have served in the undeclared wars and conflicts since then while the service remained in its peacetime department.The Pentagon, in Arlington County, Virginia, across the Potomac River from Washington, D.C., is the headquarters of the Department of Defense. The Department of Defense is protected by the Pentagon Force Protection Agency which ensures law enforcement and security for The Pentagon and various other jurisdictions throughout the National Capital Region (NCR)
Another major mission came in July 1988 when, by presidential order, the agency assumed management of the nation’s stockpile of strategic materials from the General Services Administration. Soon after, DLA established the Defense National Stockpile Center as a primary-level field activity. In 1989, the military services were directed to transfer one million consumable items to DLA for management.The 1980s brought other changes as well. On October 1, 1986, the Goldwater-Nichols Reorganization Act identified DLA as a combat support agency and required that the selection the DLA Director be approved by the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff. The act also directed the Office of the Secretary of Defense to study the functions and organizational structure of DLA to determine the most effective and economical means of providing required services to its customers. It helped the agency’s mission evolve from functional concerns (e.g. inventory management, contract administration) to operational concerns (e.g. enhancement of materiel readiness and sustainability of the military services and the unified and specified commands).Further implementation of reorganization recommendations, especially from the Goldwater-Nichols Act, resulted from Secretary of Defense Richard Cheney’s Defense Management Review report to the President in July 1989. The report emphasized improving management efficiencies in the Defense Department by ""cutting excess infrastructure, eliminating redundant functions and initiating common business practices."" After the implementation of the Defense Management Review decisions, DLA assumed some of the military services’ responsibilities, such as inventory management and distribution functions.

This type of phone communicates with an artificial satellite which then broadcasts the call either the base station or the satellite phone. Only one satellite can broadcast in a wider area in comparison to a local base station and since satellite phones are expensive their usage is mostly done to make long distance calls and where there is no mobile phone connectivity such as hilly areas, boats in the open seas disaster prone areas.
This phone directly run with a artificial satellite ,which connect with base stations and other satellites , one satellite produce more than base station.
This type of phone is directly communicate with artificial Satellite,which is than transmit the call to local base station or other Satellite.Only one Satellite,which is provide comprehension for big area as compare to local base station.Because of satellite phone is costly so It's basically use is limited to long distance area,there is not any mobile phone comprehension,like mountain mountaineer,ferryman in open ocean and journalist in disaster area.

Development of mobile services happened by using the concept of Six M (Earlier 5 M) service-development concept, which was developed by writer Tomi Ahonen with Joe Barrett of Nokia and Paul Goding of Motorola. These six Ms are: place, time, ownership, mass users, funds and automation. Six M/ five M concept is used widely in Telecom facilities literature and mostly by big industry. Services for UMTS was the first book, written by Ahonen and Barrett in 2002, which discussed this concept.
The development of mobile application is use by the 6M(before 5m) service -develop principle,which is build by writer Tomee Anhinen with the Paoul golding of Barret and Motorola.This 6 M is -move(place),pal(time),I(privatization),multi-users(union users),money(payment),and machine(automatic).6M/5M  principle are used in telecoms application and mostly used by main industries.service for UMTS,this is the first book of comment for this principle which was wrote by Ahonen and Barnet in 2002.
The Global Service for Mobile communications (GSM), with the greatest worldwide number of users, succumbs to several security vulnerabilities. In the GSM, only the airway traffic between the Mobile Station (MS) and the Base Transceiver Station (BTS) is optionally encrypted with a weak and broken stream cipher (A5/1 or A5/2). The authentication is unilateral and also vulnerable. There are also many other security vulnerabilities and shortcomings[37]. Such vulnerabilities are inherent to SMS as one of the superior and well-tried services with a global availability in the GSM networks. SMS messaging has some extra security vulnerabilities due to its store-and-forward feature, and the problem of fake SMS that can be conducted via the Internet. When a user is roaming, SMS content passes through different networks, perhaps including the Internet, and is exposed to various vulnerabilities and attacks. Another concern arises when an adversary gets access to a phone and reads the previous unprotected messages
When the VMSC/SGSN indicates a short message delivery failure, the SMSC may send a message to the HLR, using the MAP_REPORT_SM_DELIVERY_STATUS procedure, indicating the reason for the delivery failure and requesting that the SMSC be put on a list of service centres wanting to be notified when the destination party becomes available again. The HLR will set a flag against the destination account, indicating that it is unavailable for short message delivery, and store the SMSC's address in the Message Waiting Data (MWD) list for the destination party. Valid flags are Mobile Not Reachable Flag (MNRF), Memory Capacity Exceeded Flag (MCEF) and Mobile Not Reachable for GPRS (MNRG). The HLR will now start responding to SRI-for-SM requests with a failure, indicating the failure reason, and will automatically add the requesting SMSC's address to the MWD list for the destination party. (However if the SRI-for-SM message has priority flag set then the HLR will reply with VLR address if available)

It is right to explain here that during that period Arabs were so proud on their knowledge of language that they say the remaining world as inarticulate.

""One person have terrorist one and person's independent army"".This examples are group uses irregular military and one and one helpful states.
The pejorative connotations of the word can be summed up in the aphorism, ""One man's terrorist is another man's freedom fighter"".[45] This is exemplified when a group using irregular military methods is an ally of a state against a mutual enemy, but later falls out with the state and starts to use those methods against its former ally. During World War II, the Malayan People’s Anti-Japanese Army was allied with the British, but during the Malayan Emergency, members of its successor (the Malayan Races Liberation Army), were branded ""terrorists"" by the British.[51][52] More recently, Ronald Reagan and others in the American administration frequently called the Afghan Mujahideen ""freedom fighters"" during their war against the Soviet Union,[53] yet twenty years later, when a new generation of Afghan men are fighting against what they perceive to be a regime installed by foreign powers, their attacks are labelled ""terrorism"" by George W. Bush.[54][55] Groups accused of terrorism understandably prefer terms reflecting legitimate military or ideological action.[56][57][58] Leading terrorism researcher Professor Martin Rudner, director of the Canadian Centre of Intelligence and Security Studies at Ottawa's Carleton University, defines ""terrorist acts"" as attacks against civilians for political or other ideological goals, and said:“ There is the famous statement: 'One man's terrorist is another man's freedom fighter.' But that is grossly misleading. It assesses the validity of the cause when terrorism is an act. One can have a perfectly beautiful cause and yet if one commits terrorist acts, it is terrorism regardless
In different countries terrorist have differnt motives - some famous terrorist groups are Irregular military, Malayan people Anti japanes army, Malayan emergency, Liberation army, soviet union militancy, afghan mujahadin

Mostly Indian educated like N.S.Rajaram , K.sadanand , subhash kaka according to sky calculations.
The Mahabharata itself (1.1.61) distinguishes a core portion of 24,000 verses, the Bharata proper, as opposed to additional secondary material, while the Ashvalayana Grhyasutra (3.4.4) makes a similar distinction. At least three redactions of the text are commonly recognized: Jaya (Victory) with 8,800 verses attributed to Vyasa, Bharata with 24,000 verses as recited by Vaisampayana, and finally the Mahabharata as recited by Ugrasrava Sauti with over 100,000 verses.[8][9] However, some scholars such as John Brockington, argue that Jaya and Bharata refer to the same text, and ascribe the theory of Jaya with 8,800 verses to a misreading of a verse in Adiparvan (1.1.81).[10] The redaction of this large body of text was carried out after formal principles, emphasizing the numbers 18 and 12.

Coming of light into the earth, which is called as irradiance, is said to have probably lessened Global warming in the 20th century, since at that time only little light came to earth. From 1960 to 1990 human made aerosols have much more increased this phenomenon. Scientist have told with 66-90 percent belief that human made aerosols,including volcanic activity lessens global warming a little bit and green house gas warming which is seen until now could have been much more if these lessening agents were not there.
Light rays on earth, called irradiance, may have caused reduction in global dimming in the 20th century, because less light reached the earth then.  From 1960 to 1990, this situation got magnified by the man made aerocells.  Scientists have said that it can be said with 66-90 percent confidence level thatman made aerocells, and the volcanic processes reduce the global warming and green house gases will raise this warming more than what is experienced till now if they are not the reason for its reduction.
sun rays are on the earth  is called irradiance by which global dimming is lessened
Irradiance, or the absorption of light by the earth may have reduced global warming in the 20th century. In 1960 to 1990, the earth had received lesser light in comparison. Man-produced aerosols increased the levels, and if they are not present, volcanic actions and emissions of greenhouse gases are likely to be harmful.

In present the earth moves around with the sun and the moon in outer space. The earth moves around its axis 366.26 times which is the time to complete one sidereal year which is equivalent to 365.26 solar days. The rotational axis of the earth is tilted perpendicularly at a distance of 23.6 across the orbital plane by which creates diverse weather conditions on the earth in one tropical year (365.24 solar days). The moon is the Earth's only known natural satellite, which started revolving around the earth about 4.53 billion years ago, creates oceanic tides, keeps the axis rotations steady and slows down rotations of the planet. During the initial history of the planet a comet bombardment helped in the formation of the oceaans.
Earth Intracts with other objects in outer space, espacially sun and moon. At present earth orbits the sun once for every roughly 366.26 times it rotates on its axis, which is equal to 365.26 solar days, or one sidereal year. The Earth axis of rotation is tilted 23.4 away form the perpendicular to its orbital plane, producing seasonal varition ont the planet's surface whith a period of one tropical year(365.24 solar days). Earth's only known natural satellite, the moon, which began orbiting it about 4.53 billion years ago, provides ocean tides, stabilizes the axial tilt and gradually slows the plane's rotation. Planet's early days numerous asteroid impacts during the late heay bombardment caused significant changes to the surface environment.

In 19th century roundarm bowling was replaced by Underarm bowling. Both types were suspicious. County clubs started forming during this time such as Sussex CCC, who formed County Championship. British Empire had provided valuable contribution for this game. During mid of 19th century, this game was transformed to India, North America, Caribbean, South Africa, Australia and New Zeland. In 1944, first time match held between United States and Canada (However neither of the states declared as a Test Players)
The 19th century saw underarm bowling replaced by first roundarm and then overarm bowling. Both developments were controversial. Organisation of the game at county level led to the creation of the county clubs, starting with Sussex CCC in 1839, which ultimately formed the official County Championship in 1890. Meanwhile, the British Empire had been instrumental in spreading the game overseas and by the middle of the 19th century it had become well established in India, North America, the Caribbean, South Africa, Australia and New Zealand. In 1844, the first international cricket match took place between the United States and Canada (although neither has ever been ranked as a Test-playing nation).In 1859, a team of England players went on the first overseas tour (to North America) and in 1862, an English team made the first tour of Australia. In 1876–77, an England team took part in the first-ever Test match at the Melbourne Cricket Ground against Australia.
Cricket certainly thrived after the Restoration in 1660 and is believed to have first attracted gamblers making large bets at this time. In 1664, the ""Cavalier"" Parliament passed the Gaming Act 1664 which limited stakes to £100, although that was still a fortune at the time,[1] equivalent to about £12 thousand in present day terms [7]. Cricket had certainly become a significant gambling sport by the end of the 17th century. There is a newspaper report of a ""great match"" played in Sussex in 1697 which was 11-a-side and played for high stakes of 50 guineas a side.[6]With freedom of the press having been granted in 1696, cricket for the first time could be reported in the newspapers. But it was a long time before the newspaper industry adapted sufficiently to provide frequent, let alone comprehensive, coverage of the game. During the first half of the 18th century, press reports tended to focus on the betting rather than on the play.
Cricket faced its first real crisis during the 18th century when major matches virtually ceased during the Seven Years War. This was largely due to shortage of players and lack of investment. But the game survived and the ""Hambledon Era"" proper began in the mid-1760s.Cricket faced another major crisis at the beginning of the 19th century when a cessation of major matches occurred during the culminating period of the Napoleonic Wars. Again, the causes were shortage of players and lack of investment. But, as in the 1760s, the game survived and a slow recovery began in 1815.MCC was itself the centre of controversy in the Regency period, largely on account of the enmity between Lord Frederick Beauclerk and George Osbaldeston. In 1817, their intrigues and jealousies exploded into a match-fixing scandal with the top player William Lambert being banned from playing at Lord's Cricket Ground for life. Gambling scandals in cricket have been going on since the 17th century.In the 1820s, cricket faced a major crisis of its own making as the campaign to allow roundarm bowling gathered pace.

The expanded contract administration mission significantly altered the shape of DSA. The agency that had begun operations three years earlier with more than 90 percent of its resources devoted to supply operations had evolved to one almost evenly divided between supply support and logistics services. As part of a streamlining effort, in 1975, the eleven DCAS regions were reduced to nine. The following year, officials reorganized the DCAS field structure to eliminate the intermediate command supervisory levels known as DCAS districts.As the move to consolidate Defense contracting progressed, a congressional report in 1972 recommended centralizing the disposal of DOD property for better accountability. In response, on September 12, 1972, DSA established the Defense Property Disposal Service (later renamed the Defense Reutilization and Marketing Service) at the Michigan Battle Creek Sanitarium, (now renamed the Hart-Dole-Inouye Federal Center) as a primary-level field activity.
During the 1990s, the agency’s role in supporting military contingencies and humanitarian assistance operations grew dramatically. Operation Desert Shield began in August 1990 in response to an Iraqi invasion of Kuwait. Soon after President George Bush announced the involvement of the U.S. military, the agency was at the center of the effort to support the deployment to the Middle East and later the war. In those first critical months, most of the supplies transported to Saudi Arabia - from bread to boots, from nerve gas antidote to jet fuel - came from DLA stock. During this operation and the subsequent Operation Desert Storm, the agency provided the military services with over $3 billion of food, clothing, textiles, medical supplies, and weapons system repair parts in response to over 2 million requisitions. The mission execution included providing supply support, contract management, and technical and logistics services to all military services, unified commands, and several allied nations. The quality of supply support that DLA provided American combat forces during these operations earned it the Joint Meritorious Service Award in 1991.
On July 26, 1947, Truman signed the National Security Act of 1947, which set up the ""National Military Establishment"" to begin operations on September 18, the day after the Senate confirmed James V. Forrestal as the first Secretary of Defense. The Establishment had the unfortunate abbreviation ""NME"" (with a pronunciation virtually identical to ""enemy""), and was renamed the ""Department of Defense"" (also described in the Act under ""Title II - The Department of Defense"", and later abbreviated as ""DoD"") on August 10, 1949.The name-shift from ""Department of War"" to ""Department of Defense"" has been seen as an acceptance of Carl von Clausewitz's second maxim from his famous work On War. Clausewitz states: ""The aggressor always pretends to be peace-loving because he would like to achieve his conquests without bloodshed . . . Therefore, aggression must be presented as a defensive reaction by the aggressor nation.""[3] Hugh Nibley comments: ""Nobody ever attacks. You're always just on the defensive.

We cannot appreciate the classical music unless we make an attempt to listen to it and understand its intricacies and imaginative beauty.  Some what like this is the situation when the man is on top.  Here now time has come to make the classic position as civil and systemic, and investigate into the reasons for its being classic.  Along with this, I want to make it clear that when the man is on top, the aim should not at all be seen as the woman experiences a negative forceful relationship.  Nor it can be called as a boring position of the old times, just as some people nowadays think about positions with the man on top.  We can make some modifications in this position and make it a position which gives great experience.  In all these positions, the responsibility for thrusts is on the man.  For any fundamental position, a bit of talking to each other at the start is very effective.  If there is communication gap, any position is not as enjoyable to either of them as they imagine.  In fact every woman wants to see her man in such a shape and mould that he can be goaded to the extreme end of the pleasures of sex.  For this the requirement is choice of a good position, which they can discuss and gels with their imagined shape.  This effort is a great stimulant for a magnificient arousal.  If they are once successful in doing this, they can focus on their favourite spot and take great pleasure of the ride.  Here it is also necessary to mention that most men choose the position with them on the top because they can reach the height of excitement.  As such, a natural advantage of this position is that by men being on top, it is powerful position.  But in this position if the man goes with high speed and closeness from the beginning, they will definitely become weak and lose excitement during the last stages of sex, because they cannot be in control of the rhythm of sex.  This position is very good for people who are new entrants, but when it can be used imaginatively, it is very enjoyable for all classes.  Therefore it is necessary that the woman tells the man that he be in contrlo and experiment and see in which modification they get more pleasure.
whole responsibility lies with the male to push while having sex. this is old but evergreen position.for any position discussion should be having with the partner.for new entry this is the best position. they need to maintain the flow to enjoy the sex in this position.
We cannot undestand classical music unless and until we hear it and try to understand the quality and beauty of its components. The same is the case of a sex position when a man is on top. This is that time when one needs to make the classic position more elegant and find out why it is a classic position. Another thing that needs to be understood is that when the man is on top, it does not have to mean that the woman is going to experience idle and powerful sexual gerations. Nor these positions can be called the boring positions of the past just the way some people think about the positions that involve men on top. By making some small changes these positions can be made elegant. In all this positions effort needs to be made by the man. Before any inital position it is better to talk to your partner. If there is any kind of communication gap, then no position would be comfortable for both the partners. This means that every woman wants that her mate has such size and shape that can push her to the limits of sexual excitement and for this there is a need for a great position that has been discussed and decided according to her needs and which pushes her to the limit of sexual climax. If they are successful in doing this just once, they can repeat whenever they want to reach the limits of sexual excitement. One thing that needs to be told is that most men choose men on top position so that they can reach an orgasm. This is why the men on top position is a powerful position. But is in this position is the man is fast and powerful from the begining then it may lead to loss of feeling and stamina at the end. This position is very good for those who are relatively new to sex, but when excitement is taken into consideration this position is good for everyone. This is why it is necessary that the women tell their partner to stay in control and try to experiment and determine which position is good for satisfcation of both their needs.
we will not try to see the classic posiotn till we try the and experience and have the postion. this is adrsh(classic posion)is considered healthy and also i wanted to make it clear that man sit staight in the woman and she shold not  feel that she is loding all her strenght nor this postion is considered an old fashiponed position as nowawdyts mwn are thinking . thid postion can also made beautigully and man is th head of this posion and it is agood experionce and if there is communicaiton gap then man and woman canot have any position and there can be no comfortableness. thics matter shoild be discused betwen husband and wife and wife should shafre everything she has a problem wiht him so that there should be no communcaiton gap.if this problem is solved then it weill be eeasy for them to have af oreplay in anyn positon.there are number of postion where man and woman can have foreplay and satisfy themselves.

Because of less clearnce, air pollution happens in places where people spend most of their time.  Radon (Rn) gas is a carcinogen, which comes out of the earth at some places and spreads in the houses.  Formaldehyde (H2CO) gas is emitted from building materials like carpets and plywood.  While dryinig, paints and solvents emit volatile organic compounds (VOCs).  Lead based paint can turn into dust and can go inside the body through breathing.  Deliberate air pollution is caused by air fresheners, incense and other scented materials.  Smoke from the stoves in which wood is burnt in a controlled manner, and from the fireplaces, can add in considerable quantities to the inner and outer air, the effect of smoking.  Insecticides' and chemicals' sprays without adequate ventillation can cause harmful effects by internal pollution.
Due reduced emission air pollution occur internally where people spend their maximum time. Radon gas which is a carcinogen emit from some part of earth accumulate inside houses. House hold items like carpet and plywood emit formaldehyde gas. On drying paint and solvent release Volatile Organic Compounds. Lead  paint can transform into dust  and can enter body with breathing. Desirable air pollution caused by air freshener, incense and other fragrant items. Controlled burning of wood in stove and smoke at fire place add considerable element of smoke in internal and external air. Use of insecticides and chemical spray without proper ventilation may lead to harmful internal air pollution.
International catastrophes such as the wreck of the Amoco Cadiz oil tanker off the coast of Brittany in 1978 and the Bhopal disaster in 1984 have demonstrated the universality of such events and the scale on which efforts to address them needed to engage. The borderless nature of atmosphere and oceans inevitably resulted in the implication of pollution on a planetary level with the issue of global warming. Most recently the term persistent organic pollutant (POP) has come to describe a group of chemicals such as PBDEs and PFCs among others. Though their effects remain somewhat less well understood owing to a lack of experimental data, they have been detected in various ecological habitats far removed from industrial activity such as the Arctic, demonstrating diffusion and bioaccumulation after only a relatively brief period of widespread use.Growing evidence of local and global pollution and an increasingly informed public over time have given rise to environmentalism and the environmental movement, which generally seek to limit human impact on the environment.
For the scarcity of nikas air pollution happens where people mostly waste the time.Redan gas,one carcinogen,carpet and from the plywood formaldehyde.

The way a normal human being gets confused/upset after facing lot of troubles in his life and decides to leave this world for peace , the same way Arjun , the superhero of Mahabharta is scared of all hardships he has faced. He is depressed with the life of a warrior . Like Arjun we also, sometimes lose hope in time of crisis and turn our faces away from our responsibilities.
Just like a common man who gets entangled in his routine life and gets depressed and thereafter tries to run away from the daily chores of life Arjun who is the main hero of Mahabharat was scared of the problems to be faced in life and was disappointed from his Kshatriya religion, just like Arjun we also sometimes during our indecisiveness get depressed and do walk away from our basic duties toward life.
Just as a common man gets ruffled by the problems in his life and becomes puzzled about the course of action to be taken & tries to run away from the problem, Arjun,the hero of Mahabharat gets distressed by the problems, forgets his duties. Like Arjun, sometimes we all get caught in situation of indecisiveness, become distressed or troubled by problems, flee away from the duties.
Arjun is the chief of the army who leads the battle of Mahabharath. But he is unable to face the problems.In despair he cannot make out what to do or what not to do. In our daily life everyone like Arjun faces this problem and we deny to accomplish our duty.

For example, in Jamaica, an AT & T customers discounted international service can pay an additional 0.65 per minute while a B - Mobile (Jamaica) International Service for the same client / bin / sh.20 pay per minute have to. Some service providers are focusing on their sales. For example, Jamaica's national phone C & W (Cable & Wireless) to replace the company Wahi B - local calls on mobile customer will pay less but more on international calls. The price difference is mainly due to currency changes in the local currency is the purchase of the SIM. In the U.S., this type of competition in services does not exist because some major service provider to pay - as - you - go do not offer the service. [Pay - as - you - go Requirements References, T - Mobile rumor, Verizon one provided, AT & T 12/2008 not].
For example, in Jamaica, an AT & T customers discounted international services will have to pay anything extra for the 65 husband-minute service providers differentiate their sales while focusing on national sales regional sales Kanderia do something for example, Jamaika's national phone C & W (only and wireless) to replace the company Wahi B - mobile customers at fixed periods, but international calls will be paying more on the price difference is caused mainly because of currency Parivrthana SIM purchase is in local currency competition in such services in the U.S. do not exist because some major service providers offer the service does not get paid when you (when you go Bugtan requirements model T Mobile rumor, verizon offers a not AT & T 12/2008)
For example, in Jamaica, a AT&T customer opted for an international service. Additional payment of 65 per minute can be made, whereas a B-Mobile (Jamaica) customer has to pay for an equivalent international service /bin/sh.20 for every minute.  Some service providers focus on international sales, whereas some others on regional sales.  For example, The National Phone Company of Jamaica, Cable and Wireless (C&W) Company's position is that the same B-phone customers spend less on local calls and more on international calls.  This difference is mainly because of the currency conversion, because SIM card is purchased in local currency.  In America, there is no competition for such services because some prominent service providers do not offer settle-when-you-quit service.  [settlement-when-you-quit requirements Reference, T-Mobile Report, Offer to Verizon One, AT&T not till 12/2008]
For example, In Jamaica, A AT&T subscriber may pay an additional charge of .65 per minute, whereas a B-Mobile (Jamaica) will be charged a /bin/sh.20 per minute for international calls. Some providers base their charges on international networks that they use.For example, a person using a local C&W (cable and wireless)network linked to a B-Mobile network will need to pay extra for international calls. This charge is also based on currency rates,since Sim is bought at national rates.In the United States, the service providers are not in competition and hence are not on as-you-come-basis.

In 1824, Joseph Phoriar,  invented the greenhouse effect, and in 1886, first time Svante Arrhenius tested its amount.
Greenhouse effect was discovered by Joseph Fourier in 1824 and the first time in 1896 svanteArrhenius was examined by its quantitative
The greenhouse effect is detected in 1824 by Joseph Forier and its voluminous analysis is done for the first time in 1896 by Svante Arrhenius.
Effect of greenhouse was found out by Joseph Phoriyar in year 1824 and for first time quantitative investigation was done by Svante Arrhenius in 1896
Because this is a harmful gas , because of this nature become very hot , and water changes in to polluted and positive feedback and re action is done when ever feed back.
Because water flood itself a greenhouse gas, hence the atmosphere become more warm and consequently more water changes to floods(positive feedback) and this natural cycle goes on until when there is no stop at the emission of ultra violet light, the effect of the alone carbon dioxide will be very huge.
Because water vapor itself is a green house gas, the atmosphere become more hot, and this leads to further evaporation of water (positive feedback), and this reaction continue on till positive feedback is not checked. The effect of carbon dioxide alone will be significant.
The water - vapor itself is a greenhouse gas, so it gets hot and its atmosphere even more and more water vapor changes. Positive Feedback, and the reaction goes on until the feedback cycle not stop to look. Only carbon dioxide resulting from the effect would be enormous.

These models are based on the theories of transportation of fluids, radiative transfer and other processes, rough borders are smoothened as the computers have their own limits, and systems of climatic planning are complex.  All modern climate models take an environmental model in them and this depends on the models of the sea and ice on earth and on the sea.  In some models, effect of chemical and biological processes is also considered.  In these models it comes to light that if the effect of the greenhouse gases is considered, it results in a warm climate.  Even so, the assumption is made that climate sensitivity has a big role.
These models are based on, physics principles of liquid movement, radiative transfer and other process. In some places it is simplified, because computer has its limitations, and climate system has vary complexity. All modern climate models has environmental models in it. It get separate from ocean model or soil and models of ice on ocean. Some model have included the treatment of chemical and biological processes. These models measure effect of green house gases and we get worm climate adding these effects. Then also, when using these assumption there is big role of climate sensitivity.
These models are based on basic principals, radiative transfer and other processes. Computer has its own limits and air-water patterns are very complex in nature. All modern air-water models consist of one more model which is adjoined with the model on oceans and land. Some models have chemical and biological processes contained within. These models find out if the effect of green houses gases are added together then what will be the effect on climate. Climate sensitivity also has a very important role in this.
These models study the transformations in materials, their radiative transfer, and state the facts in a comprehensive and easy way.The reason is that the capabilities of a computer are limited and the measurements are complex.There are different models like the environmental model, the oceanic model, the ice models(that on earth and on water i.e. icebergs) and all these models are linked together. Some models are also used for studying the chemical and biological changes and see the effect of emission of greenhouse gases on them. Climate sensitivity of different factors is studied and measured.
In the western world than the United States than in Europe, the idea of the human impact on climate is so strong that Jiaada
In comparison of western world, Europe has a stronger opinion about the affects of man on climate.

W.G.Grace started his long carrier in 1865; it is said that his carrier took revolution in this game. The Ashes formed during England and Australia match in 1882. This was the famous test match. Test matches brought up during 1888-89 when South Africa played against England during two decade before first world war. That was known as ""The Golden Age of Cricket"". This name is result of adverse situation of war. But great players developed during this time and they played great cricket. Especially County matches and Test matches grown-up.
W G Grace started his long career in 1865; his career is often said to have revolutionised the sport.[20] The rivalry between England and Australia gave birth to The Ashes in 1882 and this has remained Test cricket's most famous contest[citation needed]. Test cricket began to expand in 1888–89 when South Africa played England. The last two decades before the First World War have been called the ""Golden Age of cricket"". It is a nostalgic name prompted by the collective sense of loss resulting from the war, but the period did produce some great players and memorable matches, especially as organised competition at county and Test level developed.
The ""Great Cricketer"", W G Grace, made his first-class debut in 1865. His feats did much to increase the game's popularity and he introduced technical innovations which revolutionised the game, particularly in batting.The growth of cricket in the mid and late 19th century was assisted by the development of the railway network. For the first time, teams from a long distance apart could play one other without a prohibitively time-consuming journey. Spectators could travel longer distances to matches, increasing the size of crowds.In 1864, another bowling revolution resulted in the legalisation of overarm and in the same year Wisden Cricketers' Almanack was first published.
In 1859, a team of leading English professionals set off to North America on the first-ever overseas tour and, in 1862, the first English team toured Australia.Between May and October 1868, a team of Australian Aborigines toured England in what was the first Australian cricket team to travel overseas.In 1877, an England touring team in Australia played two matches against full Australian XIs that are now regarded as the inaugural Test matches. The following year, the Australians toured England for the first time and were a spectacular success. No Tests were played on that tour but more soon followed and, at The Oval in 1882, arguably the most famous match of all time gave rise to The Ashes. South Africa became the third Test nation in 1889.

Description of this is is only indicative and vary clear in constitution, but this purpose, three parts are descriptively described in constitution, because of parliamentary democracy, separation in ministry is entirely not happed. Ministry is selected from parliament and responsible for his lower assembly.
(blank space)
This principal is not elaborated in Indian constitution. All three parts have been briefly discussed in the constitution. Because India is a parliament republic, legislative cannot be completely separated from the executive. legislative members are elected by the parliament and they are answerable to the lower assembly.
This is just a signal of not being shown in the constitution. Therefore all the three parts have strong description in Parliament of India and there cannot be complete difference in legislators. Council is being selected from the legislators only and it is also responsible for lower houses.

The origins of the Defense Logistics Agency (DLA) date back to World War II when America’s huge military buildup required the rapid procurement of vast amounts of munitions and supplies. During the war, the military services began to coordinate more extensively when it came to procurement, particularly procurement of petroleum products, medical supplies, clothing, and other commodities. The main offices of the Army and Navy for each commodity were collocated. After the war, the call grew louder for more complete coordination throughout the whole field of supply - including storage, distribution, transportation, and other aspects of supply. In 1947, there were seven supply systems in the Army, plus an Air Technical Service Command, and 18 systems in the Navy, including the quartermaster of the Marine Corps. Passage of the National Security Act of 1947 prompted new efforts to eliminate duplication and overlap among the services in the supply area and laid the foundation for the eventual creation of a single integrated supply agency. The act created the Munitions Board, which began to reorganize these major supply categories into joint procurement agencies. Meanwhile, in 1949, the Commission on the Organization of the Executive Branch of the Government (Hoover Commission), a presidential commission headed by former President Herbert Hoover, recommended that the National Security Act be specifically amended so as to strengthen the authority of the Secretary of Defense so that he could integrate the organization and procedures of the various phases of supply in the military services.
Very often, the victims of terrorism are targeted not because they are threats, but because they are specific ""symbols, tools, animals or corrupt beings""[citation needed] that tie into a specific view of the world that the terrorists possess. Their suffering accomplishes the terrorists' goals of instilling fear, getting their message out to an audience or otherwise satisfying the demands of their often radical religious and political agendas.Among the various definitions there are several that do not recognize the possibility of legitimate use of violence by civilians against an invader in an occupied country.[citation needed] Other definitions would label as terrorist groups only the resistance movements that oppose an invader with violent acts that undiscriminately kill or harm civilians and non-combatants, thus making a distinction between lawful and unlawful use of violence.[citation needed] According to Ali Khan, the distinction lies ultimatedly in a political judgment
as ""Commander in Chief"" of the Army, Navy and state militias.[16] The President exercises this control both through White House national security staff as well as civilians within DoD. Historically, there have been challenges to civilian control. Most notably, during the Korean War, General Douglas MacArthur ignored civilian instructions regarding advancing troops toward the Yazoo River, which triggered an introduction of massive forces from China. Also, on April 5, 1950, Representative Joseph William Martin, Jr., the Minority leader of the United States House of Representatives, released copies of a letter from MacArthur critical of President Harry Truman's limited-war strategy to the press and read it aloud on the floor of the house.[17] President Truman relieved MacArthur of command, and MacArthur then explored political options against Truman

He also said that it is possible to build ""a full GSM interceptor ... from open source components"" but that they had not done so because of legal concerns.[15]In 2010, threatpost.com reported that ""A group of cryptographers has developed a new attack that has broken Kasumi, the encryption algorithm used to secure traffic on 3G GSM wireless networks. The technique enables them to recover a full key by using a tactic known as a related-key attack, but experts say it is not the end of the world for Kasumi.""[16] Kasumi is the name for the A5/3 algorithm, used to secure most 3G traffic.

The key idea for SMS was to use this telephony-optimized system, and to transport messages on the signaling paths needed to control the telephony traffic during time periods when no signaling traffic existed. In this way, unused resources in the system could be used to transport messages at minimal cost. However, it was necessary to limit the length of the messages to 128 bytes (later improved to 140 bytes, or 160 seven-bit characters) so that the messages could fit into the existing signaling formats.This concept allowed SMS to be implemented in every mobile station by updating its software. This concept was instrumental for the implementation of SMS in every mobile station ever produced and in every network from early days. Hence, a large base of SMS capable terminals and networks existed when the users began to utilize the SMS.[7] A new network element required was a specialized short message service center, and enhancements were required to the radio capacity and network transport infrastructure to accommodate growing SMS traffic.

Peter Scott and other researchers say that water-air models give a lot of preference to green house gases and not to solar forcing. They also say that volcanic dust and aerosols are not given due importance.
Two researchers of Duke University, Bruce West and Nicola Scafetta have made judgment that son has contributed 45-50% to risen the temperature during 1900-2000 and between 1980 and 2000 contributed by 25-35. peter Scott and other researchers have found that Watergas model green house impacted more and solar forcing which doesn't have much impact.They also suggested that volcano, dust Aerosols are at lower scales compare to that.

Slowly than land-sea temperature increase because more heat capacity of the oceans is more evaporation than they can lose heat. Northern Hemisphere land so much quicker than the southern hemisphere is warming. Northern Hemisphere seasonal snow and sea ice in the larger area of which depend on ice-albedo feedback. Northern Hemisphere Southern Hemisphere than in the more Green House gases are emitted, but this summer is not responsible for the difference in the major Green House gases remain long enough to mix well in both hemispheres - is found.
Temperature in sea as compared to land increases slowly because oceans have higher heat capacity and they lose heat due to evaporation. Northern hemisphere has more land and hence it heats up faster than southern hemisphere.In northern hemisphere there are large areas of seasonal ice and ocean ice that depends on ice-albedo feedback. Southern hemisphere as compared to northern hemisphere generates more greenhouse gases, but this is not responsible for the heat difference because main greenhouse gases remain for a very long time and they mix in both the spheres nicely.
The temperature in the oceans increases slower compared to the land, because the heat capacity of the great oceans is high, and they can lose more heat by vaporisation.  In the Northern Hemisphere, land is more, and so compared to the Southern Hemisphere it gets warm faster.  There are places in the Northern Hemisphere where the seasonal and oceanic ice is spread, which depend on ice-albedo feedback.  More greenhouse gases get emitted in the Northern Hemisphere compared to the Southern Hemisphere, but this is not responsible for the difference in temperatures, because the main greenhouse gases remain for a long time and get mixed well in the two Hemispheres.

Many times the words ""terrorist"" and ""extremism"" used interchangeably.but they are different in between this two words  terrorism means danger or physical violence. Extremism means physical political uses .
Many times the words like "" terrorism"" and ""extremism"" are interchangeably used .However, there is a major difference between the two. Terrorism
Over the years, many people have attempted to come up with a terrorist profile to attempt to explain these individuals' actions through their psychology and social circumstances. Others, like Roderick Hindery, have sought to discern profiles in the propaganda tactics used by terrorists. Some security organizations designate these groups as violent non-state actors.[87] A 2007 study by economist Alan B. Krueger found that terrorists were less likely to come from an impoverished background (28% vs. 33%) and more likely to have at least a high-school education (47% vs. 38%). Another analysis found only 16% of terrorists came from impoverished families, vs. 30% of male Palestinians, and over 60% had gone beyond high school, vs. 15% of the populace.[88]To avoid detection, a terrorist will look, dress, and behave normally until executing the assigned mission. Some claim that attempts to profile terrorists based on personality, physical, or sociological traits are not useful.[89] The physical and behavioral description of the terrorist could describe almost any normal person.[90] However, the majority of terrorist attacks are carried out by military age men, aged 16–40
Terrorist are also calles as extremist but they have thier own differnt working style. Examples - irani revolution in 1979
Bye is an extra run batsman getting when batsman misses the ball and it passes through wicket kipper from which batsman gets time to take run in conventional way(note that it is a sign of a good wicket keeper to give minimum byes)
Bye-is an extra run that the batsman gains if he misses the ball and it passes from the wicket keepers hands too. This can give the chance for the batsman to run a single run between the wickets. A good wicket keeper, however, is one that allows the least number of byes.
Byes - The extra run got to batsman, when batsman miss the ball, and ball went through the wicket keeper, and batsman get the chance to takes the run traditionally. (keep in mind, this is sine of good wicket keeper that he will give vary minimum byes.)
By is an extra given to the batsman when the batsman misses the ball and the ball escapes from near the wicket keeper giving time to the batsaman to take runs(note that the mark of a good wicket keeper is that he gives few byes).

By this time, Hindustani had become the general public's language. To distinguish themselves from the general masses, the learned Muslims used to write in Urdu (filled with Persian and Arabic vocabulary), while Khadiboli became prominent among educated Hindus. Khadiboli with heavily Sanskritized vocabulary or Sahityik Hindi (Literary Hindi) was popularized by the writings of Swami Dayananda Saraswati, Bhartendu Harishchandra and others. Bhartendu Harishchandra preferred Braj Bhasha for poetry, but for prose, he deliberately used Khadiboli. Other important writers of this period are Mahavir Prasad Dwivedi, Maithili Sharan Gupt, R N Tripathi and Gopala Sharan Sinha. The rising numbers of newspapers and magazines made Khadiboli popular among the educated people. Chandrakanta, written by Devaki Nandan Khatri, is considered the first authentic work of prose in the Adhunik kaal (modern period). A story of magical characters, kings and kingdoms, it reminds one of The Lord of the Rings series and was successfully manifested into an eponymous TV Serial.The person who brought realism in the Hindi prose literature was Munshi Premchand, who is considered as the most revered figure in the world of Hindi fiction and progressive movement. Before Premchand, the Hindi literature revolved around fairy or magical tales, entertaining stories and religious themes. Premchand's novels have been translated into many other languages.

Keeping in mind the future uncertianities in the density of the green house gases, IPCC has hypothesised a caution till the end of the 21st century.  In comparison with 1989 - 1999 conditions, to investigate the causes of recent climate changes, change estimating models are used.
By keeping in mind the the impossibilities of future green house gases humidity, IPCC calculates the warning at the end of 21th century. As compared to 1980-1999, the model is used to test the causes of recent climate change. Measured changes are compared to the changes of model.
Considering the uncertainty of the future, IPCC thinks of issuing a warning towards the end of 21 century. 1980-1999 model was recently used to identify the reasons of recent climate change. For this measured changes are compared by the measurements of model.
There is a warning stated to all countries regarding the ill effects of the emission of greenhouse gases in the future,and these are called the IPCC.Climate models study causes of climate change as compared with those in 1980-1999, and they study the changes that have taken place on earth from those times.
Issue of climate change has brought a new dispute o reduce industrial emissions of the greenhouse gas Faidemaanda or going to spend on it is harmful Jiaada been discussed in many countries alternative energy sources (Alternative Energy Sources) how much it costs to adopt come and how much it will benefit Competitive Enterprise Institute (Competitive Enterprise institute) and companies such as ExxonMobil, have spoken of us a bad state of climate Jiaada imagine not taking the steps that are too expensive Jiaada Likewise, various environmental Public Alambie and many people who launched the campaign of climate change risks (risks of climate change) and stringent control of the thrust bearing is advocating some Kamapneoan Jiwanhama fuel the efforts of recent rainfall has reduced Uaya Global Warming to the policies advocated
The matter of climate change has started a new debate, that the industrial emission of green house gas is more profitable or the associated costs are more harmful.In many countries,the costs and profits of alternative energy sources has been debated.The competitive enterprise institute and companies like ExxonMobil have said that, that they should not use more costly steps by imagining worse climate.Likewise different public lobbies of climate have started the moves to reduce the risks of climate change and have advocated tighter controls.Some of the companies of fossil fuel have reduced their efforts or advocated their policies.
greenhouse gas industrial emissions to be reduced and the costs is high.alternative energy sources needs to be concentrated upon and costs to be bared for this. enterprise and competitive enterprise institute and Exxon Mobil like companies to stop the things which is more costly and risks of climate change. to support the global warming.
This put new problem green house industrial emission working is profitable the cost on that is most harmful many countries discussed that alternative energy source how much cost it takes.
