45708_65	5	We cannot undestand classical music unless and until we hear it and try to understand the quality and beauty of its components. The same is the case of a sex position when a man is on top. This is that time when one needs to make the classic position more elegant and find out why it is a classic position. Another thing that needs to be understood is that when the man is on top, it does not have to mean that the woman is going to experience idle and powerful sexual gerations. Nor these positions can be called the boring positions of the past just the way some people think about the positions that involve men on top. By making some small changes these positions can be made elegant. In all this positions effort needs to be made by the man. Before any inital position it is better to talk to your partner. If there is any kind of communication gap, then no position would be comfortable for both the partners. This means that every woman wants that her mate has such size and shape that can push her to the limits of sexual excitement and for this there is a need for a great position that has been discussed and decided according to her needs and which pushes her to the limit of sexual climax. If they are successful in doing this just once, they can repeat whenever they want to reach the limits of sexual excitement. One thing that needs to be told is that most men choose men on top position so that they can reach an orgasm. This is why the men on top position is a powerful position. But is in this position is the man is fast and powerful from the begining then it may lead to loss of feeling and stamina at the end. This position is very good for those who are relatively new to sex, but when excitement is taken into consideration this position is good for everyone. This is why it is necessary that the women tell their partner to stay in control and try to experiment and determine which position is good for satisfcation of both their needs.	4	We cannot appreciate the classical music unless we make an attempt to listen to it and understand its intricacies and imaginative beauty.  Some what like this is the situation when the man is on top.  Here now time has come to make the classic position as civil and systemic, and investigate into the reasons for its being classic.  Along with this, I want to make it clear that when the man is on top, the aim should not at all be seen as the woman experiences a negative forceful relationship.  Nor it can be called as a boring position of the old times, just as some people nowadays think about positions with the man on top.  We can make some modifications in this position and make it a position which gives great experience.  In all these positions, the responsibility for thrusts is on the man.  For any fundamental position, a bit of talking to each other at the start is very effective.  If there is communication gap, any position is not as enjoyable to either of them as they imagine.  In fact every woman wants to see her man in such a shape and mould that he can be goaded to the extreme end of the pleasures of sex.  For this the requirement is choice of a good position, which they can discuss and gels with their imagined shape.  This effort is a great stimulant for a magnificient arousal.  If they are once successful in doing this, they can focus on their favourite spot and take great pleasure of the ride.  Here it is also necessary to mention that most men choose the position with them on the top because they can reach the height of excitement.  As such, a natural advantage of this position is that by men being on top, it is powerful position.  But in this position if the man goes with high speed and closeness from the beginning, they will definitely become weak and lose excitement during the last stages of sex, because they cannot be in control of the rhythm of sex.  This position is very good for people who are new entrants, but when it can be used imaginatively, it is very enjoyable for all classes.  Therefore it is necessary that the woman tells the man that he be in contrlo and experiment and see in which modification they get more pleasure.	1	we will not try to see the classic posiotn till we try the and experience and have the postion. this is adrsh(classic posion)is considered healthy and also i wanted to make it clear that man sit staight in the woman and she shold not  feel that she is loding all her strenght nor this postion is considered an old fashiponed position as nowawdyts mwn are thinking . thid postion can also made beautigully and man is th head of this posion and it is agood experionce and if there is communicaiton gap then man and woman canot have any position and there can be no comfortableness. thics matter shoild be discused betwen husband and wife and wife should shafre everything she has a problem wiht him so that there should be no communcaiton gap.if this problem is solved then it weill be eeasy for them to have af oreplay in anyn positon.there are number of postion where man and woman can have foreplay and satisfy themselves.	0	whole responsibility lies with the male to push while having sex. this is old but evergreen position.for any position discussion should be having with the partner.for new entry this is the best position. they need to maintain the flow to enjoy the sex in this position.	0

872_275	5	Keeping a double stand like this on the issue of Indian partition, Gandhi opened the areas of perceptions from both Hindus and Muslims.  Muhammad Ali Jinnah and contemporary Pakistanis accused Gandhi of undermining the political rights of the Muslims.  Vinayak Damodar Savarkar and his colleagues blamed Gandhi and accused that he was coaxing the Muslims, that he was indifferent to the crimes committed against the Hindus, and that he had already accepted the formation of Pakistan (though he publicly announced that he may be cut into two pieces before partition).  This is even today politically debatable, as Pakistani-American historian Ayesha Jalal gives the logic that Gandhi and Congress were not willing to share power with Muslim League.  Other Hindu nationalist and political leader Pravin Togadia also considers this issue in the leadership of Gandhi, and also suggests that partition happened because of the extreme weakness of his group.	5	Gandhiji was liked by hindus as well as muslim thats one reason he was agiant division.

Another Hindu writer Pramod Togadia division was done due to weakness of gandhi only	0

26300_70	4	The emission temperature of infrared radiation depends on the intensity, from the upper layers of the atmosphere longwave radiation is emitted, and from the lower layers, this is less.  Most of the radiation emitted from the upper layers goes into the space, whereas the radiation from the lower layers enters the atmosphere again and gets absorbed by it.  In this way, the green house effect depends on the rate of decrease of temperature with the height.  If the temperature decrease rate is less green house effect is less and vice versa.  Theories and models both indicate that due to the worming effect, the decrease in temperature as we go up is reduced.  A negative lapse rate feedback is produced and this makes the green house effect weak.  Calculation of the rate of change of temperature with height is very subtle and sensitive to tiny changes, and so it is very difficult to find out whether the model represents the reality or not.	3	the suitable method of indemnity or our method of complications are done by the interested one for all.	1	(blank space)	0

872_254	5	Generally the word Mahatma is misunderstood in western countries. This word comes from a sanskrit word.

Other sources claim that this titile was bestowed upon him by Nautamlal Bhagavanji Mehta on 21st January 1915.

872_282	5	If I were a Jew born in Germany, I would have been living in Germany and would have considered Germany as my mother country. Even if a fellow German would have threatened to kill me or imprison me in the darkest jail, I would never give in to accepting something which in my opinion is not right.This is why I will wait for my Jewish brothers to join me in my stand against the wrongful things.I am, in fact, confident that everyone will regard me as a model, and follow my actions.If one or all Jews accept the method stated here,their living conditions will not deteriorate more than they have till now.If they succeed in tolerating the pain given to them, they will attain internal power and happiness. This will be the first revolt against the actions of Hitler, who has indulged in manslaughter and planned violence.If the minds of the Jews learn to tolerate pain voluntarily, the day of death will also transform into a Thanksgiving Day or a joyous day.Just like Jihova gave his whole tribe in the hands of a tyrant. One who fears God does not feel the fear of death.	4	If I were a Jew and born in Germany and was earning my livelihood there itself I would consider Germany as my home in spite of some German citizen threatening me that he would shoot me and kill me or throw me in a dark dungeon, I will refuse to become subservient to insecular and fugitive practices.  And I will not anticipate my Jewish brothers to come and restore my costitutional citizenship, but I will be self confident that in the end all will be bound to emulate my example.  If even one or all Jews accept the prescription given here, their condition will not be worse than what it is today, and if they emdure the torturing willingly, then it will give them internal strength and joy, and Hitler's well planned torture also will show up as a common human massacre and this will be the first answer against the annnouncement of his misdeeds.  If the mind of the Jews gets prepared to willingly endure torture, then I imagine that sad days also will convert into days of joy and memorable as if converted by Jehova .. did this by surrendering his clan into the hands of an oppressor.

And calculated violence of Hitler's genocide of the Jews as a simple male to be extracted and the announcement of atrocities against his will first answer. To bear the suffering of the Jews voluntarily Hyar mind, my imagination that Sshar Thanksgiving Day and enjoy the day will change. As Jivoha ..... wrought by the hands of a tyrant by giving his nation. Having the fear of God not afraid of the terror of death.	0

872_291	5	The Former President of South Africa, Nelson Mandela, is a folower of Gandhiji.In 2003,he unveiled a statue of Gandhi in Johannsberg in spite of strong opposition by Gandhijis critics.Bhana and Wahed have described events that happened during the unveiling of the statue, in their book, The Making Of A Political Reformer:Gandhi In South Africa,1913-1914.In the Chapter, Gandhijis gift to South Africa,They write,"Gandhiji inspired active reformers in South Africa to end white superiority.

In response to these two view points about Gandhi, Bhana and Wahed argue: those who want to quote Gandhi for their political thinking after apartheid are not helping his cause by quoting wrongly about him.   And those who call him a racist are also equally guilty of wrong judjement/ wrong depiction.	1	ex president  of south Africa Nelson Mandela was follower of gandhiji.He supported in Johannesburg about the gandhi ji thinking.He even wrote about gandhiji.The work which was started by gandhiji has been ended by the nelson mandela successfully.	0	South Africa's former president Nelson Mandela is a follower of Gandhi in 2003 Gandhi statue unveiled by critics yet he's trying to stop him in Johannesburg was exposed.

Brocade they keep referring to the disputes which had broken during the unveiling of the statue of Gandhi.

872_289	5	Gandhijis earlier articles from South Africa have been highly debated. On 7th March 1908, Gandhiji, in the "Indian Opinion", wrote about his imprisonment in South Africa. He wrote that "It seems an uncivilized rule, moreso when one is a prisoner.Prisoners live difficult, dirty lives like animals." In 1903, He wrote, "I believe that I also belong to a pure race, as they do.But i agree that the whites in South Africa should be considered as a higher race." In his days in South Africa, Gandhiji often opposed the unfair treatment of Indians by the whites, and he describes this as,"It is definitely better than the Kaffirs."It is worth considering that the meaning of Kaffirs in Gandhiji's times was quite different than its meaning today.Gandhiji, in his articles, has urged some people in declaring themselves as a higher race.	3	The first writings of Gandhi on South Afrca are quite controversial. On 7 March, 1908, Gandhi wrote in "Indian Opinion" about his jail lif " Infidels are uncivilised in command - as inmates of jails more so.  They live hard, dirty and almost like animals".  In 1903, Gandhi wrote a commentary on immigrants' issue that "I concede that as much as they believe in the purity of their race, we also believe equally..we agree that in South Africa the white race has to be the better one".  During his time in South Africa, Gandhi opposed the social classification of Indians along with non-whites, about whom he describes that "undoubtedly and in total better than the infidels".  It needs attention that the word infidel had a different connotation in Gandhi's time than its present day usage.  These narratives of Gandi made it possible to accuse him as a racist by some people.	2	Gandhi's South Africa over the initial articles are very controversial. March 7, 1908, the dirty in the Indian Opinion in South Africa, wrote about his prison life "in Kafer rule uncivilized - the prisoner so as well. They painful, dirty and live almost like animals." About the topic of immigration in 1903, Gandhi remarked that "may agree that the accuracy as much as they rely on their race as we also ..... We believe that the white race in South Africa it the best race should be. Gandhi during his time in South Africa again - often with the social categorization of Indians over blacks opposed, whom they describe the "Sure is better than completely infidels." It is worth noting that at the time of Gandhi in the present Kafer (a different connotation) are used to sense a different meaning (Its Present - day usage). These statements by Gandhi by some species they have a chance to put the charge to the plaintiff.	0	On 7th March,1908 Gandhi ji in Indian opinion has written about his jail life in South Africa.There was lot of difference between black and white in South Africa. White people hated black one.They thought that they are the great people.It was a different connotion used in its present day usage.	0

26300_123	5	These models study the transformations in materials, their radiative transfer, and state the facts in a comprehensive and easy way.The reason is that the capabilities of a computer are limited and the measurements are complex.There are different models like the environmental model, the oceanic model, the ice models(that on earth and on water i.e. icebergs) and all these models are linked together. Some models are also used for studying the chemical and biological changes and see the effect of emission of greenhouse gases on them. Climate sensitivity of different factors is studied and measured.	3	These models are based on the theories of transportation of fluids, radiative transfer and other processes, rough borders are smoothened as the computers have their own limits, and systems of climatic planning are complex.  All modern climate models take an environmental model in them and this depends on the models of the sea and ice on earth and on the sea.  In some models, effect of chemical and biological processes is also considered.  In these models it comes to light that if the effect of the greenhouse gases is considered, it results in a warm climate.  Even so, the assumption is made that climate sensitivity has a big role.	2	These models are based on basic principals, radiative transfer and other processes. Computer has its own limits and air-water patterns are very complex in nature. All modern air-water models consist of one more model which is adjoined with the model on oceans and land. Some models have chemical and biological processes contained within. These models find out if the effect of green houses gases are added together then what will be the effect on climate. Climate sensitivity also has a very important role in this.	0	These models are based on, physics principles of liquid movement, radiative transfer and other process. In some places it is simplified, because computer has its limitations, and climate system has vary complexity. All modern climate models has environmental models in it.

28539_7	5	Sometimes stabling the situation for complete sense of pollution can have dangerous parts. For instance water is a natural drink and is a need of life but on excess consumption it can turn to be a pollutant. If some person drinks water excessively it can put a lot of weight on his physiology and can result into death. Other example is that excessive pollution can distort the mental stability of a person which can result into problems for the body activities ans psychosis; this has been used in wars as a weapon.	3	Sometimes, in the wide interpretation of the word pollution, production of unnatural pollutants harmful to the stability of the establishment is built into the system.  For example, water is harmless and is essential to life, but at very high density, it can be considered a pollutant: if any person drinks water in large quantity, there can be high load on the physical system and to such an extent that he can fall ill and even die.  Another example is that the mental balance of a person can be spoiled by excessive noise, the result of which is disturbance in the bodily functions and psychosis; this is used as an elephant in war.	2	Sometimes by elaborating the word pollution, disturbing elements are found. For example water is safe and necessary for the life but it is counted polluted of it is too salty. If someone drinks too much water then he may be burden for physical system and he can be died too. One ore example, by too much noise human can be mental which causes to psychosis and can be used as a weapon in war.	0	pollution is difficult for the human life. for example water is necessary for humans but more consuming of water also burdens the health .in the same way more pollution also kills human beings	0

28539_112	5	It is useful to consider that environmental policy comprises two major terms: environment and policy. Environment primarily refers to the ecological dimension (ecosystems), but can also take account of social dimension (quality of life) and an economic dimension (resource management). [2] Policy can be defined as a "course of action or principle adopted or proposed by a government, party, business or individual" [3]. Thus, environmental policy focuses on problems arising from human impact on the environment, which retroacts onto human society by having a (negative) impact on human values such as good health or the 'clean and green' environment.    Environmental issues generally addressed by environmental policy include (but are not limited to) air and water pollution, waste management, ecosystem management, biodiversity protection, and the protection of natural resources, wildlife and endangered species. Relatively recently, environmental policy has also attended to the communication of environmental issues	3	On a large scale, such simple solutions were probably effective in the earlier centuries, when the physical existence only was the focus, population and its density were low, technologies were simple and their unintended effects were soft.  But such conditions did not last long.  In addition to this, modern technologies did not have capable methods to evauate the concentration of the effects.  Use of statistical methods to evaluate led to the appreciation of the possible dangers in these issues; assurance of the estimates is available by these methods, but choice of the specified model is not practical, and also, debate on the direct effect of the environment on the mankind has become very effective.	2
