Sametime "PopularMusic" should be returned as "popular music".There is no easy way to determine which capital letter should be in capital.Due to this, many wikis use brackets and get "Free Links" and some disable camelcase by default.	2	However, this reprocessing of the link to improve the readability of the anchor is limited by the loss of capitalization information caused by CamelCase reversal.

The Northern Hemisphere warms faster than the Southern Hemisphere because it has more land and because it has extensive areas of seasonal snow and sea-ice cover.	4	THE SEA TEMPERATURE INCREASES GRADUALLY COMPARED TO LAND TEMPERATURE AS THE FORMER ABSORBS MORE HEAT AND ALSO LETS IT OUT AS VAPOUR, THEREBY LOSING THE TEMPERATURE FASTER THAN THE LATTER. OWING TO THESE TWO FACTORS, SEA TEMPERATURE INCREASES VERY SLOWLY COMPARED TO LAND TEMPERATURE. SINCE NORTH HAS MORE LAND AREA THAN THE SOUTH, IT HOTS UP FAST.	1	Reason for this is sea is having more capacity to withstand the heat and the water evaporation it loses considerable amount of the heat, the heat increase rate in sea is less when compared to land. Since north half-pole is having more space than south half-pole and having more number of ice lands where the ice gets melted more frequently, north half-pole gets heated more quickly than south half-pole.	0	Land better to ocean add heat capacity Ocean and land two loss heat capacity,these reason ocean heat stage land to slowly add North Half to South off to cold-White added to land  Tyre to added land cold ocean north half speedy heat.	0

1564_123	5	By 4 billion years ago the earth had cooled enough for the outer layers to have solidified and for oceans to form. Flying past the earth at this time we would see a vast ocean from pole to pole, with volcanoes scattered here and there but no continents - pretty much the scene to the right captured about about 3.8-4.0 billion years ago. The oldest rocks we have date to 3.96 billion years ago, and contain evidence of sedimentary rocks that require water.       The earth cooled from the outside in, and the still molten iron-nickle core are the remnants of that heat from the early stage of melting. That heat is also what keeps the earth geologically active, and without it nothing that we know of the earth would exist today, no continents, no volcanos, no mountains, no oceans, and almost certainly no life - a dead planet like mars or the moon.	2	Major part of earth's heat is due to radioactive decay, scientists believe that in the early stage of earth,before short half lived isotopes disappeared,earth heat must much higher and before three billion years the heat twice than the present,earth's temperature characteristics much have changed,more mantle spreads,tectonic plate movements,ignited rocks called komatiites formation ( not formed today ).	2	SINCE THE TEMPERATURE MOSTLY DEVELOPS FROM NUCLEAR DAMAGE, SCIENTISTS BELIEVE THAT IN THE BEGINNING PERIODS, THE TEMPERATURE MIGHT HAVE RISEN BEFORE THE DISAPPEARANCE OF SHORT-LIVED ISOTOPES AND WHEN THREE BILLION YEARS BEFORE, DOUBLE THE TEMPERATURE WAS CREATED COMPARED TO NOW, THE NATURE OF ABSORBING HEAT MIGHT HAVE CHANGED AND DUE TO FACTORS LIKE MOVEMENT OF TECTONIC PLATES, BESIDES FORMATION OF KOMATIITES (WHICH DO NOT HAPPEN TODAY) IT MAY HAVE TAKEN PLACE	1	The temperature of earth depends upon the collision of atoms,Scientist in the beginning stage of earth when disappear of isotopes form high temperature of the earth and Before 3 billions of years the present temperature is twice than the temperature which is formed.In earth there is a changes in condition which depends the temperature,this is because of spreading of snows,Tectonic movement , formation of hot rocks(Komatiites)	0

5649_137	5	The executive summary of the WG I Summary for Policymakers report says they are certain that emissions resulting from human activities are substantially increasing the atmospheric concentrations of the greenhouse gases, resulting on average in an additional warming of the Earth's surface. They calculate with confidence that CO2 has been responsible for over half the enhanced greenhouse effect. The major conclusion was that research since 1990 did "not affect our fundamental understanding of the science of the greenhouse effect and either confirm or do not justify alteration of the major conclusions of the first IPCC scientific assessment". It noted that transient (time-dependent) simulations, which had been very preliminary in the FAR, were now improved, but did not include aerosol or ozone changes.	3	IPCC(Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change)work group -III is bearing the responsibility of preparing the reports on the prevention of Global warming and its various approaches,expenses cost and the benefits out of it.The Fourth Assessment Report of IPCC was passed in the year 2007 which decides that No technology or Sector could bear the entire responsibility of the prevention of forth coming global warming. Gas distribution,Transportation,Industrial sector and Agriculture contains various important practices and technology for the same. IPCC recommends to implement these technologies to reduce the emission of polluted gas. Also it has evaluated that if the amount of carbon-di-oxide is controlled between 445 to 710ppm, we could have the entire warming controlled between 0.6% increase to the 3% decrease.	1	IPCC'S ACTION COMMITTEE III HAS BEEN GIVEN THE RESPONSIBILITY OF PREPARING STATEMENTS RELATING TO COOLING THE EARTH'S TEMPERATURE AND PROBING THE EXPENSES AND BENEFITS INVOLVED IN THE PROCEDURE. THE IPCC'S FOURTH ESTIMATES REPORT IN 2007 CLARIFIED THAT IT WILL NOT BE POSSIBLE FOR ANY TECHNIQUE OR FIELD TO SHOULDER COMPLETE RESPONSIBILITY TO COOL DOWN THE TEMPERATURE. IN MANY FIELDS LIKE SUPPLY OF FUEL, TRANSPORT, LABOUR AND AGRICULTURE, IMPORTANT PROCEDURES AND TECHNICAL ADVANCEMENT ARE THERE. IT SAID THAT TO BRING DOWN THE GAS EMISSIONS WORLDWIDE, THESE HAVE TO BE USED EFFECTIVELY.  PROVIDED THE LEVEL OF CARBON DIOXIDE IS MADE STABLE BETWEEN 445 AND 710 PPM BEFORE 2030, THE TOTAL WORLDWIDE PRODUCTION WILL WITNESS A RISE OF UPTO 0.6% AND A DECLINE E UPTO 3%, THE REPORTS SAID	1	To control the global warming by IPCC organisation ruled many items.

When inhaled at concentrations much higher than usual atmospheric levels, it can produce a sour taste in the mouth and a stinging sensation in the nose and throat. These effects result from the gas dissolving in the mucous membranes and saliva, forming a weak solution of carbonic acid.A convenient property for this purpose is that solid carbon dioxide sublimes directly into the gas phase leaving no liquid. It can often be found in grocery stores and laboratories, and it is also used in the shipping industry.

A research conducted by David Douglas and his friends in 2007 found out that when the results of 22 leading climate models were compared with that of original results, the changes that were noticed in the model types were not exactly calculated. However, there are claims that recent studies entirely differ in opinion with the earlier one. A research conducted in 2008 by a 17-member team,led by Ben Santer, has claimed in a statement that the Douglas' research was full of calculation errors. The difference in calculation between the model ones and the original was not much, it said.	2	The problem in creating climatic sample was its dissimilarity with the actual situation. In 2007 as per the analysis made by David Ductus and his team, they compared 22 leading climate samples with the real climate levels, and found out that these samples were not accurately calculated the changes happened in the hot environment zone. But scholars felt these results were in contradiction with the recent analysis report made in the same level. In 2008, Lawrence Livermore national research center's Ben Santer and his team of 17 members made a research on Ducles experiment and found out that there are lot of mathematical and assumption errors found in that. Hence they told there is not big statistical difference between the climate samples and the real one.	2	Small problems in climatic model developments is difference between the actual situation and model resemblance. In 2007 David Ductus and his team research done comparison with 22 top earth climate  model with original climatic changes event.  They conclude they haven't calculated the actual temperature in lower atmospheric regions and from their research they show the variation between theirs temperature values and other researches conducted before. Lawrence Live more National researcher Ben Santer headed a 17 members team in 2008 from their research showed mathematical errors is Douglas research, wrong assumptions and conclude there is no deviation in model and research as per his research.	1	temperature  is making of a small problem to what the true situation of samples to calculate of show the fixed of joint decision.
