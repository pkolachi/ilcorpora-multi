Complex Number Set can be defined in this manner .
When a person start learn addition and subtraction for first time then he comes to know about positive integer number .
For example , someone is payable Rs 5 by me , at that time , there is money with me means I am a owner of Rs -5 at that moment .
In this respect it can be presumed that all varieties of mathematics began with some assumptions .
This is the primary hurdle in learning complex numbers .
But it is being explained .
In complex number there is a imaginary part and a real part .
If there is a zero in the right side of the system then that system is called non minimum phase system .

.This event is presently known as Hubble 's principle .
Hoyle , in a program on the BBC named Third Program , on 28th March , 1949 , remarked insinuatingly this theory of Lemaitre as " " Big Bang " " to mean a big chaos .
Among the several researches about the theology of the universe , one of the most important research is to finding out the process of creation and evolution of the galaxies in the light of the theory of Big Bang .
The age of the universe that is derived based on three measurements is almost 13.7 ± 0.2 billion years
After the universal expansion was stopped a matter was there in the universe called Quark-Gluon Plasma .
Due to this breakdown the mentionable numbers in Physics can stay variably .
After a short period of time proton and neutron were unified to form the nucleus of deuterium and helium , the primary constituents of the universe .
For this reason all the elements of the other place which are much bit more denser than the places of this gets attracted by the gravitational force .
If the extent of the Universe is defined by means of speed-distance graph then the line of the graph is not rectilinear .
No useful theory has been as yet discovered in the physics to explain the condition of 10-33 seconds after the Big Bang .
It can be easily understood from it that this metric would be FRW metric .
Because the light ray for a particular travel covers as much distance is equal to the moving conformal distance .
The light can not reach to us from the matters which has more comoving distance .
There are two possible explanations to observe the principles of Hubble - one is : we are near the center of an explosion in the galaxy .
Another name of this is CMB which was formed with the emitted photon during the first Baryogenesis .
In the primitive earth the temperature equal was going on so the reflecting light of that time was blackbody reflector .
In 2003 , more accurate information can be obtained via artificial satelite named WMAP

It is possible to resolve this problem with the theory of cosmic inflation .
The word Pali itself signifies " " line " " or " " -LRB- canonical -RRB- text " . " This name for the language seems to have its origins in commentarial traditions , wherein the Pali
But there no confusion regarding that this are the unique innovation in the universe .
Though it has created lots of debates immediately after discovery , most of the cosmologists now accepted this .
According to this statistics , the density of the universe is only 30 percent of the density of the Earth .
According to the data found by WMAP in 2006 , 74 % of the Universe is dark energy , 22 % is dark matter and only 4 % is regular matter .
The name of this condition is Heat Death Of The Universe
Here , the epoch of the expanding universe have been shown as the metric expansion directed in the left

This theory deos not support some religeous and universal viewpoint .
Presently The Roman Catholic Church supports the Big Bang theory and believes that the Big Bang theory is consistent with Genesis of the Bible .
For example , in the third book of Bhagbat Puran -LRB- Chapter 10 , 26 -RRB- an earliest state is mentioned which exploded when Vishnu put his view on this .
Initially these standard principles were considered as postulates .

The complex numbers create a field .
Rafayal Bomblin an Italian mathematician first discovered the process of addition , subtraction , multiplication or division of the complex numbers .
For example . 3 + 2i is a complex number whose real part is 3 and imaginary part is 2 .
The plot of f -LRB- x -RRB- = -LRB- x2 - 1 -RRB- -LRB- x - 2 - i -RRB- 2 / -LRB- x2 + 2 + 2i -RRB- function .
In this case X axis taken as real part and Y axis taken as imaginary part .
Or this .
This means
Complex numbers are added , subtracted , multiplied , and divided by formally applying the associative , commutative and distributive laws of algebra , together with the equation
Additive absence of distinction -LRB- " " Sunyo " " -RRB- , 0 + 0i ;
The complex number z can be seen as a two digit vector on Cartesian Co-Ordinate System .
From here we get that and if we define distance in a complex plane in this way then the complex number set turns into a metric space and then we can define limit and continuity .
on complex plane sum x = A + B of two points A and B is similar to triangle 0 , A , B and triangle X , A,B .
to get unique representation , arg -LRB- 0 -RRB- = 0
The obtained value of Ф from this formula is confined this range -LRB- -n , + n -RRB-
To find out the multiplication , division , index and roots in the polar form
We can represent . -LRB- -1 -RRB- = + 1 trigonometrically that it is a two times 180 degree rotation .
From here we can see it easily that b = 0 .
Till then he know that it is not possible to subtract large number from a small number .
But after that when he gets introduced to complex number during learning of higher mathematics then it would be difficult to find a real example such as this .
The assumptions that we accept without any proof -LRB- actually proof is impossible -RRB- .
Therefore , complex numbers are that much complex , imaginary or real as complex , imaginary or real the other numbers are .
The operation is distributive only when a and b are positive real numbers .

.According to the principle of universe , when the universe is observed depending the distance on a huge scale , no definite or specific direction is found .
Even after that , in number of other occasion , he was seen to have used this term as well .
Apart from this , to determine exactly how and why the Big Bang was occurred from the point of view of the universal theology .
These three measurements are : the measurement of the expansion of the universe by using the first type of very new stars , the measurement of the variations of temperature on the context of the universal small waves the measurement of the correlations between the milky ways .
Probably this type of a matter has been made presently by the scientists which is known as Quark-Gluon fluid .
In this time only this single particles are made whic is still in that primitive state .
This process of the creation of the universe is called the synthesis of the nucleus of the big bang .
For this is made the stars , space and all the things of the galaxy those are visible to our eyes .
This happens due to some invisible force .
To explain the difference of form before this specified time there is no alternative of the Grand Unified Theory .
These metrics depend on a certain coordinate frame which is spread throughout the time-space and through which we can identify a point in the universe .
From this only the relation of place-time was known .

Some example can be shown like number of ball in a bag or one dozen banana etc .
Though some examples are taken with the help of root of some polynomials , those are not perfect .
Only from this observation that they are effective in solving real life problems and are not contradictory .
So , by avoiding the literal meaning of the terms of complex numbers , imaginary part etc. the correct picture of complex numbers that we get is like this .
So the equation is incorrect .

Among these photons there were two types of energy density : constant mass energy density and radiation energy density .
But the main factors of this subject is depended on the type and the quantity of the substance present in the space .
Therefore , with increasing distance rate of acceleration increase proportionately .
It is said that at this point the density was infinite .
Lines of this frame expand in a particular rate and direction with expansion of the universe .
Let we take this conformal time .

If the mass density of the Universe was greater than the critical density then the Universe will reach its maximum size and start to collapse .
What may happen as aresult of this is not certainly known
Our knowledge of the time , which we have presumed to be the starting point of the expansion , is very limited .
like electronic gadget and many other
According to some , the Big Bang theory contradicts the traditional viewpoint , as the genesis of bible explains differently .
Islam religion
According to this religion , universe is limitless and goes through creation and destruction .
Cosmological isotropy that defines the universal principles has been measured correctly up to 10-5 degree ; in large scale structure the universe has been found to be homogeneous at 10 per cent correction level .
This can be explained with recessional velocity .
Expanding universe theory was proposed as a solution to this problem .
Regarding Physical content see the index of reading book .

Where a particular result is taken as this .
Then he can imagine this point number or float number by some example like total distance etc .
Due to this confusions of information , it become hard -LRB- in most of the times impossible -RRB- for him to imagine the complex number as a number .
Likewise , we use complex numbers in thousands of fields like quantum mechanics , quantum physics -LRB- these two are related but different subjects -RRB- , quantum electro-dynamics and in many other higher mathematics and science issues .
Complex numbers are indispensable to solve many important and real life problems .
If under any circumstances square root is to be calculated for a negative number , it is to be written in the form so that afterwards no negative operation within the square root sign is not to be done .
Number method like Root Locus , Nyquist Plot , Nichol Plot is used to analyze on complex surface .
Like a signal which has a constant frequency can be represent by complex number .
This mathematical technique used to analyze alternate current and voltage with the help of impedance is called phasor calculus .

The broad meaning of the word Big Bang is a powerful explosion of a primeval point due to which the universe was created , also on the other side this also explains the contradictions that have arose over the ideology regarding the birth and structure of the universe following the explosion .
One Roman Catholic religious preacher George Lemaitre , for the first time could be able to prove from the space equation theory of Einstein to the equations of Friedman .
The satellite named W-map is collecting information to understand the great explosion- a picture drawn with a paint brush by an artist .
In this magazine the term " " Big Bang " " was used for the first time in printed form .
Very high efficient telescopes and their accurate functioning have made this possible .
During the early stage of the creation , the universe was complete in a balanced and uniform state of temperature with only one high energy matter of high density and pressure
Due to this reaction the Principle of Conservation of Baryon Numbers is violated and the amount of Quark and Lepton particles gets slightly increased than their anti-particles .
In a particular temperature no new proton / anti-proton can not be made below .
Since the relative velocity was reduced , the constant mass energy density took over the gravitational radiation energy density .
At that time most probably three types of elements were found in the space : cold invisible elements , hot invisible elements and Barionio element .
Considering the most ordinary things , the amount of this invisible force becomes constant , when calculating area using Einstein ’ s equation . Although the exact nature of this force is still undiscovered .
To solve this riddle of physics , a quantum theory of gravitation is necessary .
Consequently , coordinate of any astronomical object always remains the same .
Now all the elements whose comoving distance is more than this then they are so much that those lights can never come to us .
Three observations are considered as the evidence of Big Bang theory of cosmology .
Then this observation was made by considering the General Theory of Relativity as the base .
Anyway , the universe , while expanding , was also started slowly to become cold and at one stage the temperature came down below 3000 kelvin .
The reflector discovered by them was Icetrophio and the Black Body reflection in it was prominent ; and its temperature was about 3 kelvin .
It is possible to get ration of hydrogen to Heleium-4 , Helium-3 , Deuterium and Helium-7 using model of Big Bang .
this is the main evidence of big bang. as other than big bang no other matter describes this .
Problem and different important matter .
of the life things and rules must remember
If the Universe had scattered like this after the Planck Epoch then it would be impossible to have same temperature in these wider regions .
It is assumed that Universe was in statistical equilibrium or having equal numbers of baryons and antibaryons when it was young and very hot .
When the canonical texts were written down in Sri Lanka in the first century BCE , Pali stood close to a living language ; this is not the case for the commentaries
Means the power is more than any other definite power .
It is almost impossible to identify dark matter .
To explain this acceleration , such an assumption of an universe has to be accepted in the general theory of relativity where it will be necessary to be present a lot of energy factors with negative pressure .
Then it will become denser and hotter again and will reach the early stage when the Big Crunch began .
In the Lamda- CDM map of the universe the unseen power has been shown as a universal polar star
There can be some thing more present beyond the picture of the universe portrayed by the theory .
in the part of always instructions are most important for any device
Creative scientist Hugh Ross thinks that the Big Bang theory supports the theory of Ex Nihilo on the creation
Modern Islamic scholars say that the view of Quran is completely coherent with the Big Bang theory and a scientific view of it can be found in the Quran .
Though the theory of big bang can not be opposed through this theory , rather it can be supported .
Now effort is going on to measure the Copernican principle .
When a graph of distance between the objects with their recessional velocity is made , a straight line is obtained which is known as Hubble 's law .
During expansion , time-space was expanded at so high a rate that any residual curvature associated with it exhausted and a plane originated .
Religion and Philosophy
here the vector -LRB- a , b -RRB- indicates a complex number a + ib
For example , it ’ s possible to get negative real number by squaring some complex -LRB- imaginary -RRB- numbers .
From some numbers it can be understood that over there , there is a use of complex number .
That is , real number a can be taken into consideration .
In other words two complex numbers and are equal to each other if and only if and is .
So it is observed that every point of a number line is in complex surface .
Or this operations has never been changed .
Which is the form of complex number known to us !
Division :
On the other fields we have the real number and mulod numbers
Absolute value , Integral and Distance
When and only when z is real .
for example a 17 edged polygon problem can be illustrated as a x17 = 1 algebrical problem
to get the unique representation , the value of phi is considered to be -LRB- -pi , pi -RSB- that is in the interval range -pi < phi < = pi
notation of polar form
The index that we get for an whole number by The Moyevar 's law we get ,
Where a real number r is a nth positive number .
This is our known imaginary number with which the mathematical theory to deduce complex number set from real number set .
Like a person covered 1 1/2 KM distance .
Then what is Complex number ?
Where mathematical equations or numbers signify different events , quantities and numbers of real life .
That means , complex numbers are not unreal .
Application
Example , in Root Locus process if Poles and Zeros are one the left side of complex surface then it is become more important .
By using argument we can represent phase .
By extending this method , it is applied in digital signal processing and digital image processing .

On the year 1945 both the countries Germany and Japan by surrendering with no weapons made the end of the 2nd World war to come .
Most horrible among these was the nuclear bomb
But there is a common perception about it and which is mostly accepted .

According to the Big Bang theory , the universe had originated from a very dense state .
Through this the structure of the earliest matters of universe is explained , due to which Alpher – Bethe – Gamow theory has been formulated after the Big Bang theory .
Einstein had introduced these space equations for his theory of relativity .
There are two different possibilities .
Apart from these two models by Hoyle and Lemaitre there a few models on the origin of the universe as well .
At present the human beings are the proud possessors of some of the very high efficient telescopes like Kobe , Hubble 's Space Telescope and WMAP .
The laws of physics became active after 10 to 43 seconds of the creation of the universe .
That is , the amount of Quark and Lepton gets slightly increased than the amount of anti-Quark and anti-Lepton .
Along with this annihilation starts in between the proton and anti-proton .
Almost after 380,000 years of the big bang , electrons and nucleus were unified to form the atom ; mainly the hydrogen atoms were formed .
An institution named WMAP has got the most dependable information from the satellite that says that the cold invisible substance in the space is maximum around 80 parts .
This is to say that the relation between the equation of this forces ’ location and the model using particle physics , both in theory and practical ways , needs lots of observations and experiments yet .
To create a theory that will be suitable to the present time is the biggest unsolved problem to the physics at present .
Comoving distance or coordinate distance between any two points though remains the same , their physical distance increases in proportion to the scale cosmological scale factor .
So , in the past we could never see the total part of the universe .
These are : Hubble-type expansion seen in the red shifts of galaxies , the detailed measurements of the cosmic microwave background and the abundance of light elements .
This observation alone is conceded to be the fundamental background of the Theory of Big Bang .
At this point the nucleus and electrons were unified to form an atom .
This invention is a support for the definitions of Big Bang Theory and Penjias and Wilson brought Novel prize .
The abundance of these elements depends mainly on ratio of photon and barion .
unexpectedly it was seen that in the new universe the amount of helium is greater then deutorium .
At present though every observer agreed with the theory of Universe once a pone a time it was not like this .
if you do that which is not applying for any reason in the future so grab the opportunity to do some thing extra ordinary
Flatness problem
But recently it is proved in observation that almost entire observable universe is made of matter .
Despite excellent scholarship on this problem , there is persistent confusion as to the relation of Pāḷi to the vernacular spoken in the ancient kingdom
After that Scientist came to an decision that maximum power of the Universe that is near about 90 % coming from the Dark Matter .
Because it ’ s gravitational influence can not be understood properly .
This leads to the concept of the invisible energy .
On the other side , if the density in the Universe becomes equal or below the critical density then the expansion will slow down but never stop .
This theory states that only the objects that are bound by the gravitational force will remain together , such as the Milky Way ; though they will also have heat death because of the expansion and cooling of the universe .
As far as the principle of expansion is concerned , we definitely presume that the indicated expansion has pushed a greater part of the universe beyond the horizon observable by us .
before working on that must know about the instruction
A list of the explanations of the Big Bang theory by different religions is given here .
The Ayah related to this subject is -LRB- Surah Ambiya ; 21:30 -RRB- .

Scientist Edwin Hubble first stated that if the movement of the far away milky ways is collectively analyzed , it is observed that they are moving away from each other which mean that the universe is continuously expanding .
This was discovered in the decade of 1960 and proved the Big Bang theory over steady state theory .
He discovered that the lights emitting from the visible galaxies from the earth was shifting towards the red and this redshifts are proportional to their distance from the earth .
The other one is the great explosion theory of Laymetro , which was completed mainly by George Gaymaf .
But in course of time a number of important observation was undertaken the most which nodded in favor of the second theory .
General discussion
The universe started expanding at this time
As the area of the universe gets increased the temperature of it gets decreased .
The same event occurs in case of Neutron / Anti-neutron complex .
Along with the expansion the distribution of the universe was symmetrical .
The reason for the enormous strength and energy of the universe is this energy and is known as dark energy .
But mysterious phenomenons are created when we try to observe Universe at the time of its creation .
The universality of the physical principles .
Here we may introduce a concept called conformal time , in this case entire time-space metric takes the shape of an elastic metric and the basic metric can be obtained by multiplying it with aggregate scale factor .

The last recorded temperature obtained by COBE is 2.736 Kelvin .
For 2H / H , it is approximately 10.3
By studying all these observations it can be found that after around 1 billion year after the big bang that the galaxies and quasars had been formed ; and from then on the larger space was being formed such as the clusters and great clusters of galaxies .

is Hubble 's constant , the apparent value measured by WMAP is -LRB- 70 + 2.4 / -3.2 -RRB- KM / S / Mpc .
According to grand unification theory it was predicted that in the universe exist so many point errors which can express themselves as magnetic monopoles with much higher density than are commonly observed .
every complex number can be written in the form of symbol , where a and b are the real numbers
It is this observation from where the fundamental theorem of algebra came .
A complex number is expressed normally in a place where a and b are real numbers and are imaginary units , and maintains the law
So complex numbers are sometimes seen to have been written by the form a + bj .
Just like the real numbers are expressed as a point on the number line .

How much complex / real / unreal / imaginary is the given complex number ?
By hearing the name a curiosity among the students with this numbers are natural .
Then understand this from the concept of Loan .
And confirmed by observation that in ideal situation mathematical solution works as solutions to practical problems also .
" " In the same way , listening the name of complex number and looking at this type of extraordinary equation -LRB- according to his mathematical conceptions up to that point -RRB- and from the names like ' complex ' , ' imaginary ' etc. he himself starts to think that it is something ' unreal ' .
This equation is also a reason for the students to think the complex numbers to be complex or imaginary .
Rather , complex numbers are essential to mathematically describe many ' real life ' issues .
If it is on the axis , then this system is marginal stable .
Size .
There are many techniques like this .
IN ORDER TO SOLVE DIFFERENTIAL EQUATION , IN GERERAL AT FIRST , COMPLEX PROBLEMS OF CHARECTERISTIC EQUATIONS AND AFTER THAT ENTIRE SYSTEM IS EQUATED AS f -LRB- t -RRB- = ERT WHICH IS FINALLY SOLVED UTILIZING BASE FUNCTION .

History
It means that the more a galaxy away from the earth , the more is its redshift in the spectrum .
But the name of the theory of Laymetro was given by Hoyle .
After the discovery of cosmic microwave background radiation in 1964 , big bang was considered to be the most effective theory to explain the origin and development of the universe .
See also : The Diaries of the Big Bang .
From this time mainly the Exponential expansion of the universe started .
While the temperature was decreasing , at some stage , the transformation of the phase was initiated as a result of which counter equilibrium disintegration was started .
In case of electron or Anti-electron or positron this inciden occurs in the below temperature .
But still there were some asymmetries .
In the present universe almost 70 % of the total energy is this invisible force .
The energy of the matter particles was so much at that moment that despite using modern equipments we are not able do research on that .
The universal basic principles
Conformal time coordinate is quite important .
Obviously related to our watches this conformal time is infinitive which is called as proper time .
It is found from the observations of distant galaxies and quasars that these objects displays red shifts — the light emitted from them takes the shape of comparably longer wavelengths .
The theory of Big Bang had mentioned the phenomenon of cosmic microwave background radiation .
As a result , the radiation from the objects could travel throughout the whole universe without any obstruction .
More information is taken that CMB for per 105 parts takes one part Istropio .

Usually the Universe may have three types of geometry : parabolic geometry , Euclidean geometry or elliptical geometry .
These conditions are , the universe should have that baryon number which not conserved , C-symmetry and CP-symmetry has to be violated and the Universe has to be away from thermodynamic equilibrium .
the descendants of the Old Indo-Aryan dialects such as Sanskrit , and the predecessors of the late medieval languages such as Apabhramsha or Abahatta .
To solve this problem you have to consider the thought of dark matter because there is no other way .
In the 1990s , a detailed statistics on the total mass density of universe was published .
However , researches are even now going on to have a further understanding of the subject .
The entropy of the Universe will increase to a point when no organized form of energy will be available .
