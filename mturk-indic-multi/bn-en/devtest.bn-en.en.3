a and b are respectively called the real part and imaginary part of complex number.
According to this it is impossible to find a solution of a complex equation which has more than one dimension.
Real number 'a' is called as a real part of a complex number and 'b' is called as a imaginary part of a complex number.
According to the Domain Colouring process.
Complex plane or Z-plane is used for the complex numbers.
Two complex number and will be equal if they direct the same point on the complex plane.
Any complex number can be written with the help of the method described just before a few moment and we can get it if we calculate with help of the method of multiplication discussed earlier.
Through Algebraic Basis.
Particularly for the complex numbers:
geomatric representation of complex number and its conjugate
Here z and w are any complex numbers.
Addition and multiplication of complex number obey the normal rule of geometric operation.
>=0,which is called absolute measurement or modulus and phi=argument(z),which is called argument of z otherwise if r=0 then z indicates a particular point for any value of 'phi'
(See the previous function and atan2.)
which is called exponential form
Hence, geometrically, the meaning of the equation i2=-1 is two rotations of 90 degree, that is, one 180 degree (Π radian). Even, as per this (-1)
The set of complex numbers can be defined this way.
When a student first learns addition and subtraction then he get to know about the whole numbers.
For example, if some one has a due of Rs.5 from me and if I don't have any money at that time, it means that I am a owner of Rs.-5 at that time.
In this regard it can be considered that all form of mathematics have emerged on the basis of some common postulates.
This alone is the hindrance to learn the complex numbers.
But the explanation of this.
As a result, the imaginary part of the complex number is presented to be as physically real as the real part.
If zero of any system exists in the half of the right side then the system is Non-minimum Phase system.
The angular velocity is denoted by W and complex number by Z, the previous described process together can form the expansion and form.

This event is now known as Hubble's law.
.On 28 March 1949 in one of the program of BBC named Third Program, Hoyale ironically termed this theory of Lometra as ""Big Bank"",which means a huge uproar.
At present, other important subject of cosmology is the revelation of the method of galaxies formation in the context of the Big Bang.
Depending upon the three measurements the age that is calculated of the Universe is 13.7 +- 0.2 billion years.
.After the cosmic expansion came to an end,there was an element in the universe named Quark-gluon plasma.
because of these dissolution,discussed primary forces of physics gets individually independent existence.

Note
The complex numbers creat a field.
Addition, subtraction, multiplication, division of complex number was first made by mathematician of Italy Rafyel Bombellil.
Example, 3+2i is a complex number in which the real part is 3 and imaginary part is 2.
Function of x is f(x)=(x2-1)(x-2-i)2/(x2+2+2i)
In this system we use the real part along the x axis and the imaginary part along the y axis.
It means it is
That is
Addition, subtraction, multiplication, division of complex figure---all this operation can be done through co-ordination method, exchange method and distribution method and rather than they all maintain one equation.
Additive identity(""zero""), 0+0i
complex number z can be seen as a vector on the cartesian-coordinate system.

Addition of two point A and B on Complex surface X=A+B such that triangle O,A,B is equivalent to the triangle X,B,A.
in that case to get a unique expression(unique representation) argument(0)=0
The value of Φ is included in the range (-n, +n)
polar forms multiply, divide,
• (-1) = +1 can be seen, geometrically, as the rotation of two 180 degree.
From here we can easily see that when b = 0
Till then he knows that it is not possible to subtract big number from small number.
But afterwords when he comes to familiar with the complex number while learning higher mathematics then it becomes difficult for him to find out such practical examples for them.
We accept these postulates with out any proof (in fact they can not be proved).
Hence, the complex numbers are as complex or imaginary or real as the complex or imaginary or reals are all the other numbers.
The operation is distributive only when a and b are positive real numbers.

At that state all substance and strength were very heated and in a densified state.
From the efforts of observing the consistency in the structure of the Universe and theoretical considerations related to it, the Big Bang theory was developed.
When the universe is seen from the perspective of sufficiently large scale distance according to cosmological principle no definite or particular direction or place is found.
.Even after that he was seen using this name on many occasions.
And it also includes judging the process and time of the Big Bang in the context of cosmology.
This three measurements are: to measure the growth of the universe with the very old stars, to measure the change of temperature on the small electric base and the measurement of Correlation Function in the Milky Way.
.Most probably a scientific element of this type has been created at the present time which is known as Quark-gluon liquid.
in this time primary fine particles are created which is still remaining in that old position.
This process of creation is called Big Bang nucleosynthesis.
In this way stars, galaxies and other astronomic bodies are formed.
Due to invisible strength such things happen.
To explain the condition before this phase transition, grand unification theory has no parallel.
These metrics depend on a coordinate graph which are scattered everywhere in place-time and through that medium we can identify any point in this universe.
From this, the casual structure of the space-time is understood.
Which means we will never be able to influence the whole universe.
This observation is untenable given the Copernican Principle
As in the early universe there existed equilibrium of heat, radiation temperature and quantity of plasma were equal before the plasmas got united again.
Subsequently, due to the redshift as per the Hubble's Principle the temperature was reducing and deviated from their behavior like the dark matters.
By these information a number of designs relating to the Big Bang were proved to be wrong.
All these ratios can be expressed through a number well in advance.
Moreover, recently formed galaxies are normally different from older galaxies though the recent galaxies use to be in long distance.
But these problems are not much conflicting ones with the theory of Big Bang.
The concept that Information cannot move faster than light has created the problem of the horizon.

According to this theory due to the movement of branes of String theory expansion occurs; pre Big Bang model, Ekpyrotic model in which big bang is seen as the cause of collision among branes and Wheeler model.
Science is not in a position to explain some issues of the Big Bang theory and some explanations put the cause (the first cause) of Big Bang itself before question mark.
This theory has been accepted in all branches of Rabin's Jewish theory.
Apart from that, there is no start or end of the universe as per the view of another group of Hindus.

A complex number can be visually represented as a pair of numbers forming a vector on a diagram called an Argand diagram, representing the complex plane.
But while applied on the complex numbers, some more beautiful and worthwhile properties of these operations are observed.
Complex number mainly used in the field of electric magnetic, quantum physics, applied mathematics etc.
Set of a real number R can be called as a subset of C whose real numbers are those complex number whose imaginary part is zero.
Two complex number can be called as equal if their real part and imaginary part of both is equal.

For this illusive information comes from its nomenclature, it is getting difficult for him to form an image of this complex number (for most of the time it is impossible).
Likewise, we also use the complex numbers in myriads of fields such as higher mathematics or science besides quantum mechanics, quantum physics (these two are different subjects nevertheless they are interrelated), quantum electro-dynamics.
To solve several important and practical problems, the complex numbers are inevitable.
As soon as any number appears under the square root sign,write it in the form so that, later there is no operation for a negative sign under the square root sign.

under a certain temperature no new photon/per-photon bond cannot be created.
As a result of decrease in relative velocity static mass force density, due to gravitation, started dominating over the radiation force density.
Then there where three kind of elements in universe, cold invisible element, hot invisible and baronial element.
If a very normal topic is brought into consideration then the amount of strength according to Einstein's equation of area takes the shape of a universal constant, though the real phase of this strength is still not found.
To solve this physical riddle, a quantum cosmological theory is needed.
As a result the coordinates of any astronomical object always remains constant.
Now, the objects, which have comoving distance more than this, are so distant from us that the light from them can never reach us.
In the theology of the universe, three observations and experiments are put forward in support of the theory of Big Bang.
Then the observation was done on the basis of general theory of relativity.
Whatever it may be, the universe while continued to expand gradually became cooler and at one phase the temperature came down below 3,000 Kelvin.
The radiation they had discovered was isotopic and it consisted of the property of the radiation of the black matters; the temperature of that radiation was almost 3 kelvin.
It is possible to measure the ratios of common Hydrogen with Helium-4, Helium-3, Deuterium and with Helium-7 by using the designs of the Big Bang.
Anyway, this abundance is a proof in support of the theory of Big Bang; this is because apart from the theory of Big Bang, no other theories are capable to explain the amount of this abundance.
Problems and different important issue
These are identified as unsolvable problems of physics.

Then what is complex number?
Where the mathematical equations direct to the different events of our real world, measurements and the numbers.
Which means the complex numbers are not the unreal numbers.
Application
For example, the location of all poles and zeroes either in the left half-plane or in the right half-plane of the complex plane(or whether the real part of the root is greater than or smaller than zero) is very important in root locus method.

Though almost all the scientists agreed with the big bang theory recently but it was not same at some time.
To solve these problems it needs independent research on the synthesis of nucleus of the big bang, study of the cosmic microwave background radiation and study of the recent most stars existing in the formation of the broader area of the universe.

Because its gravitational effect could not be understood properly.
From this that the idea of dark energy has come.
On the other hand, if this density is less than or equal to the critical density, then at one time the expansion  will become slow, but will never end.
It is said in this theory that only gravitationally bounded matters of Universe such as galaxies will be together; however these will die in death heat as the Universe expands and cools.
In the case of expansion, we consider that the exponential expansion would push large regions of space well beyond our observable horizon.
However, its basic principles are not clearly proved yet.

Overview
At this time the universe started to expand.
As the volume of the universe increases it's temperature decreases.

Each complex number can be written in a shape, where a and b are real numbers.
The elementary theory of algebra has derived from this observation only.
A complex number can be represented in a general form, where a and b is a real number and imaginary number which obey the the theory.
For this sometime complex number is written in particular shape.
