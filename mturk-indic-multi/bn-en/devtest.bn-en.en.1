The addition, subtraction and conjugating operations follow the general geometric explainations.
Greater than equal to zero,that called as a modulus and sie=arg(z),that is called as the argument or angle.If r=0, then for any value of sie it Z refers the same point.
(See the function and atan(theta).)
Which is called exponential form.
Hence from geometric point of view, the equation i2 = -1 means two 90 degree rotation or one 180 degree rotation. Thus (-1).

This event is at present known as Hubble's Law.
Hoyle on March 28, 1949 in program called 'Third Program' broadcast in BBC Radio, mostly sarcastically, called this theory of  Lemaître 'Big Bang' which means a 'big chaos'.
In modern ages, one of the topics of the cosmologic research is the discovery of origination and revolution of galaxies in the light of big bang.
On the basis of three measurements, the age has been determined as almost 13.7 ± 0.2 Billion years.
after this there exists Quark–gluon plasma
For this incident of disintegration, the fundamental forces discussed in the physics have got separate and independent existence.

its other name is c.m.b which was created with eliminated photon in the time of first beriogenesis.
As there existed heat equilibrium in the early universe, the radiation spectrum of that time was similar to that of a black body.
In year 2003 by using satellite we got more information.
For Li-7/H it is almost 10-9
Due to this reason remote galaxies (those which are quite older) appear to be different from those (presently observed) which are comparatively closer.
Apart from the problems that have been solved, there are more problems such as: Problem of Cusip hollow and the Dwarf milky way of cold unseen matters.

Notes
These complex number formed a field of complex number.
The rule of addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division of complex numbers was created first time by the Italian mathematician Rafael Bombelli.
Like, 3+2i is a complex number, whose real part is 3 and imaginary part is 2.
The plot of the function f(x) = (x2 – 1) (x – 2 – i)2/(x2 + 2 + 2i)
In this situation real number is taken in the X-axis and imaginary number is taken in the Y-axis.
Therefore it is ""a""
It means
The addition, multiplication, division of the complex number--- all this operations follows the cooperation rule, exchange rule and give and take rule in algebra adn with this maintains this equation.
Addition (""zero""),0+0i;
Complex number z can be seen as a positional vector on a two dimensional Cartesian coordinate system.
.
X = A + B: The sum of two points A and B of the complex plane is the point X = A + B such that the triangles with vertices 0, A, B, and X, B, A, are congruent.
In this case an unique representation is arg(0)=0.
Value of theta we got from this formula is in the range of (-n,+n).
To resolve the product, quotient, power and root of the polar form.
•(-1)= +1 can be seen geometrically as two 180 degree rotation.
Here, we can easily see when b=0.
He knows by then that it's not possible to subtract smaller numbers from bigger numbers.
But later while learning higher mathematics when he met with complex number then it becomes difficult for him to find out such types of practical examples.
people should work hard to acheive thier goals.
Therefore, complex number is that much complex or imaginary or real that other complex or imaginary or real numbers are.
The operation is distributive only then when a and b are positive real numbers.

The Big Bang theory developed from the exertion to link the structure of the Universe with the theoretical considerations.
According to the theological principles of the universe, when the universe is observed from a distance of a very large scale then we don't find any definite or prominent side or space of it.
Thereafter in different programs he used that term.
Apart from that, for exactly what reason and how the big bang happened is researched in the view of cosmology.
This three measurements are: measurement  of the expansion of universe using first type ultra new star, the measurement of the ups and downs of temperature on the basis of cosmic small spectrum and the measurement of correlation function of cosmic galaxies.
presently the chemical scientists mifght have presented a mterial which is known by Quark–gluon plasma.
Right at this time the element particles were formed which are still in their primary state.
This process of creation of the universe is called the central synthesis.
As a result of this the stars, galaxies and other astronomical objects are created which we can see at present.
It happens due to the invisible power.
there is no alternative data of great unified for explain a phase of difference before this time.

From this the causal structure of space-time can be understood.
It means that we can't influence the whole universe.
After considering the main principle of Copernicus this cannot be accepted.
though in old universe thermal equilibrium system was reigning over for that temperature of radiation and volume of plasma was same until before the plasma's are gathered again.
Afterwards due to red shift according to Hubble's law their temperature continued to decrease and deviation from back body behavior could be seen.
This information proved some known rule of Universe is wrong.
These ratios can be predicted with only one number.
Moreover, even though the recently formed galaxies are remote they naturally different from the older ones.
But these problems do not confront  the Big Bang Theory much .
Information can not run faster than light, the Horizon Problem has been originated out of this thought.
The theory of universal expansion meet defects of all of the points of the universe that are observable in such a way as it creates suitable environment for denoting the formation of the universe to be plane.

According to this theory, inflation happened due to the movement of Branes in the string theory; the pre-big bang model; the Ekpyrotic model where the Big Bang is viewed as the result of a collision between Branes; and the cyclic model.
Some explanations of the Big Bang theory are not possible with science; again, some explanations put the question mark to the causes (to be precise, the first cause) of the Big Bang as explained in the theory.
This theory has been accepted in all branches of rabbinic Judaism.
Besides according to another section of Hindus there is neither any start nor any end to the universe.
But at present they are being tried to be proved.
Mainly for this reason redshift has been proven.

Where the argument of the function has been shown with colors and the value of the function has been shown by the density of shadow.
From here it can be easily seen that all the complex number are based on each points on the complex base on the X-axis, which are themselves a real number.
Their summation and multiplication are defined respectively as:
If we imagine a real number x in a complex plane in (x,0) form we would see that in this equation (y,0) is a real number which created the imaginary part (0,y) of z by multiplying with (0,1).
Adding:

This operations are much more easier in the Polar form than the Cartesian forms.
If c is a complex number and n is a positive whole number, then if, any complex number z satisfies the equation zn = c then z is called the nth root of c.
From historical point of view, theory of complex number formed quite some time after real numbers.
He may be shown some examples of number of balls in a bag or number of bananas in a bunch.
After giving some examples with some multi numbers it is not very pleasing.
The demographics of India are remarkably diverse. India is the second most populous country in the world.
Therefore, if we do not take the literal meaning of complex numbers, imaginary part, the accurate picture that we can get about complex numbers is:
Hence, the equation is impure.
In the rule of control, the physical condition is very often taken to the frequency domain from the time domain through Laplas transformation.
Complex number are used in mathematical representation of periodically changing signals in signal analysis and in some other areas.

The other description is: The universe considering the time and state is expanding in an equivalent manner.
before an atom creates,time to time radiation was emitted and again absorbed steadily which is called frequency diffusion.
In 1964 Arno Penzias and Robert Woodrow Wilson somewhat accidentally discovered background radiation.
But these information support the rule of increasing Universe.
And that number is baryon and photon ratio.
It means that the time of formation is the basic issue and evolution is the key to it.
The Big Bang theory has given rise to many such questions, for which there are no proper observatory system in our earth to provide an answer.
From this it can be understood that, if two places in the universe are far apart from each other, the distance between them is more than the speed of the light multiplied by the age of the universe, then the causal connection between them is never possible.

This was proved by the different experiments during 1970s and 80s that the amount of energy of the gravitational force existing in the galaxies and the spaces between them is apparently so huge that it is impossible for the visible matters to produce such enormous energy.
before starting the thing which is must and good is to have the knowledge about the required field
Currently this strange phenomenon points towards another aspect: independent measurements of new born stars like La, it can be established that it is actually taking part in the expansion of the Universe.
If the mass density of the universe is more than its elliptical density, then the universe would be contracting once again after reaching to a particular form through expansion.
The consequences of this has not been determined as yet.

Broadly the word Big Bang means a very powerful explosion of an oldest point by which the universe was created; on the other hand it also means the hypothesis on the creation and structure of the universe based on this explosion
A Roman Catholic priest, Georges Lemaitre first independently derived the Friedmann equations from Albert Einstein's equations in 1927.
The WMAP (Wilkinson Microwave Anisotropy Probe) satellite has collected data to understand the event of Big Bang-- the picture in the eyes of an artist.
The name 'Big Bang' was first published in printed form in this magazine.
The high powered telescope and its perfect functions made this possible.
At the early stage of origin the universe was full of high energy density and high temperature and pressure material in uniform and equal temperature form.
due to this amount of quark and lepton particles increased by a small amount.
Below a certain temperature no pair of proton/anti-proton can be formed.
As a result of reduction in relative velocity energy density due to static mass attained supremacy over energy density due to cosmological radiation.
Then there were three types of matters present in the universe: cold dark matters, hot dark matters and Baryonic matters.
If the most ordinary issues are considered, quantum of this invisible power takes the form of a cosmological constant in Einstein's field equation, though the actual nature of this invisible power could not be revealed till now.
a quantum gravitation fundamental is needed to solve this physical puzzle
if you do not see then it would be your fault
Now, the elements of which the comoving distance is more than this, they are so far apart from us that light from they never can reach us.
Three observations and experiments are cited in Universe theory as the proofs of bag bang.
Then considering the general information of density as the structure the experiment was done.
what ever,universe was getting expand side by side it was getting cold slowly slowly and in a certain stage temperature came down under 3000 kelvin.
The radiation they discovered that was isotropic and it had properties of black body radiation and its temperature was almost 3 Kelvin.
By using the map of Universe ratio of Hydrogen with Helium-4,Helium-3, Deuterium and Helium-7 can be measured.
At all events, this abundance is a clear proof in support of the Big Bang theory; because this abundance can't be explained by any other theory except the Big Bang.
Problems and different important issues
These are marked as  solution less problems of physics.
If the universe would have continued to expand this way after the Planck epoch then the temperature of this place could not have been equal.
It is assumed that when this universe was quite young and severely hot then it was maintaining a numeric equilibrium, that is, the number and Baryon and anti-Baryon was the same.
The spherical layer observation made in 1990 did not conform to the Big Bang theory.
Which means the energy was much more than the existing matters.
many other sites also
To explain this acceleration, the general theory of relativity must be adopted to an universal postulation which assumes the presence of the source of large amount of negative energy.
Then it would start to become dense and hot once again and it would reach to that old point from where the great contraction was started
In the Lambda-CDM model the dark energy is shown as a cosmological constant.
There might be something more in the universe beyond that we have so far presented with theoretical axioms.
Out of these, some are similar to each other.
The famous creationist Hugh Ross opines that the Big Bang theory adds substance to the ex nihilo theory of creation of the universe.
According to the modern Islam thinkers, the idea in Koran is consistent with the Big Bang Theory and in this regard lots of scientific vision is identified.
This theory, however, does not oppose Big Bang theory rather supports it.
At present it is being tried to measure the Copernican principles.
When the recessional velocities are plotted against the distances of objects, a linear relationship is obtained which is known as Hubble's law .
In the state of stability, the place, and time have expanded so much that that any residual curvature related to this quite nicely finished on the ground.

Example, if we do the square of complex(imaginary) number then wee may get negative number.
In some cases, it is understandable from the names that complex numbers has been used there as an underlying mathematical formation.
i.e. Real number can be thought as a.
In other words, two complex numbers and are equal to each other if and only if and
Therefore, it is seen that the numbers in all the lines of the points are based on complex numbers.

For the power of the whole number we get according to the Moyver's theorem,
Where it is implied the nth positive roots of r
This is our known imaginary unit with the help of which mathematical theories get promoted to the set of complex numbers from the set of real numbers.
As for example, let us suppose a person have crossed 1 1/2 km.
Then what is complex number?
The demographics of India are remarkably diverse. India is the second most populous country in the world.
Meaning, complex numbers are not unreal numbers.

According to the Big Bang model, the universe expanded from an extremely dense state and continues to expand today
This explains the structure of the oldest matters in the universe, for which the Alpher–Bethe–Gamow paper was created immediately after the Big Bang theory.
These equations were established by Einstein for general relativity.
Two independent possibilities are there.
In addition to the two models of Hoyle and Lemaître, a good number of models regarding creation of the universe have been proposed.
Currently, the high powered telescope like Cobe, Hubble Telescope and WMAP are available with man.

means that the amount of quark and lepton increses by per lepton and per quarks .
Along with this the annihilation of mass is initiated between rest of the proton and anti-proton
Almost after 380,000 years of the Big Bang electron and nucleus combined to form atoms; then basically hydrogen atoms were created.
It has been known from the most reliable information as received from an artificial satellite called the WMAP that the amount of cold dark matter is in the highest quantity in the universe, almost 80%.
To speak the truth, much observation and research is yet to be done both in the theoretical and the practical fields to ascertain the equation of the state of this power and its relation with the standard model of particle physics.
to understand this matter, creation of a time-befitting data is biggest unsolved problem of physics at present.
for the safety and for the precautions we must do some thing well
That is, we never can see the whole of the past universe.
These are: Hubble-type expansion accepted in view of red-shift of the galaxies, detailed estimate of cosmological microwave background and abundance of light elements.
This experiment till date is considered as the main information of the Big Bang Theory.
in this point center and electron is gathered and create atom.
This discovery became an argument in support of Big Bang theory and secured the Nobel Prize for Penzias and Wilson.
Amount of this gas mainly depends on the ratio of Photon and Brian.
Surprisingly it has been observed that in the early universe either quantity of helium is more than that of deuterium or deuterium is more than helium (He-3) but they always maintain a constant ratio.
Though majority of the researchers have presently accepted the Big Bang theory, earlier it was not so.
For finding a solutions of these problems, what is required is   independent research on Big Bang  and related subjects,  study of the root of spread of small waves in the universe and  study of the new stars present in the extended universe.
Equality problem
But the recent observations prove that the observable universe is entirely formed with matters.
Through computer simulation of the spherical layers among the number of stars in the universe it has been found that they were created almost 15 billion years ago.
After that the scientists were compelled to draw this inference that 90% of the matters existing in the universe are not the common Bayronic matters, rather, they are the dark matters.
like maharajs and sanaga nammnma is the one who made it
It is an occasion where the entire family gather,
On the other hand if this density is less than or equal to the elliptical density then at one time the rate of expansion would be slowed down but would never be ended.
In this theory it has been said that, only the gravitationally confined matters will be existing in the universe, like the galaxy; although these matter will also experience the thermal death due to the expansion and cooling off of the universe.
In case of the universal expansion we must assume that indicative expansion has pushed a vast part of the outer space out of our observable horizon.
But its main laws are not proven clearly.
A list of interpretation as given by the different religions about the Big Bang theory is produced herewith:
A noteworthy Ayat in this regard is (Surah Amibya; 21: 30):

Subsequently, a number of small states were created with the disintegration of the Russian Union.
In an armed conflict, member nation-states will be able to agree on which nation is the aggressor. All member nation-states have identical freedom of action and ability
On 3rd September Allies army declared war against Germany and the Second World War began.
Prior to that the Russian soldiers had already entered into Lithunia, Latvia and Estonia and they offered a similar proposal along with the compensation, but since Finland did not agree to that the Soviet Union attacked Finland on 30th November 1939.
Around 70 thousand soldiers out of 200 thousand were killed in this war.
On one hand, the German Force captured the important ports like Narvik.

But in the whole war, Cetnik party led by Draza Mihajlovic and Communist party led by Joseph Tito keeps attacking in Guerrilla style.
Main target of Google is to store all kind of data from all over the world and make them available for general people.
It is explained according to the general theory of relativity designed by Friedmann-Lemaître-Robertson-Walker
History
That means the red light in the spectrum of the light of galaxy is brighter as far it situated.
It was Hoyle who gave the name of this theory of Lemaitre.
After the discovery of cosmological microwave background radiation, 'Big Bang' theory was accepted as the most suitable theory to explain creation of the universe and its evolution.

Mainly from this time, the exponential expansion of universe started.
during decrease in temperature at some point changes started occuring in this and the breaking started.
This incident occurs at even lower temperature in case of electron and anti-electron or positron.
However, some inequality existed there too.
Around 70% of the total energy density of the present universe is this dark energy.
Then the energy of the particles was so high that even now no practical experiment can be conducted with them.

However, this conformal time that is called proper time is infinite compared to our clock.
It has been observed that distant galaxies and quasar exhibit red shift - wagelength of light emitted by them tends to be comparatively longer.
The Big Bang Theory says about the universal smallest wavelength .
result of that eliminated radiation get a chance to travel in whole universe with out any obstruction.
It was also known that CMB is isotropic at the rate of one in one hundred and five.
For 3He/H almost 10-4
Age of the galaxies are increasing and with that various evolutions are taking place in them.
Now with the Big Bang theory gaining popularity, these debates are viewed from historical perspectives; different modifications and sometimes superior observations were made in the theory to solve these problems.
Some important problems and related other subjects are being explained here :
In general, there can be three types of geometries present in the universe: parabolic geometry, Euclidean geometry and elliptical geometry.
In these conditions it was said that the number of Baryon in the universe should that much what is not reserved, C-symmetry and CP-symmetry should violated and the universe should be away from the state of thermal equilibrium.
However, even now doubt is there whether age of the layers had been determined properly.
There is no other way than to presume the existence of the dark matter to redress the problem.
this is a good story for every one in eny age
It only takes a few hours to be completed.The social customs are certain
The entropy of the universe, due to cumulative increase, would reach to such a point that no organized energy would be emitting from it anymore.

Hurtle-Hawking final frontier theory and other such designs where space and time have been assumed to be finite.
Accordingly many people also found discrepancies.
Pope Pius XII was a good supporter of the Big Bang theory, though this theory was not proven scientifically till then.
In Hinduism, few existentialist part, like in Vaishnava Cult, Big Bang has been supported.
