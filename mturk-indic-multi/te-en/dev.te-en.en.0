In ancient india this book is the base for all sexual related books
The Kama Sutra (also spelled Kamasutraṃ or Kamasutra; Sanskrit: कामसूत्र), is an ancient Indian Hindu text widely considered to be the standard work on human sexual behavior in Sanskrit literature written by Mallanāga Vātsyāyana. A portion of the work consists of practical advice on sexual intercourse.[1] It is largely in prose, with many inserted anustubh poetry verses. ""Kāma"" means sensual or sexual pleasure, and ""sūtra"" literally means a thread or line that holds things together, and more metaphorically refers to an aphorism (or line, rule, formula), or a collection of such aphorisms in the form of a manual

In the introduction to her own translation, Wendy Doniger, professor of the history of religions at the University of Chicago, writes that Burton ""managed to get a rough approximation of the text published in English in 1883, nasty bits and all"". The philologist and Sanskritist Professor Chlodwig Werba, of the Institute of Indology at the University of Vienna, regards the 1883 translation as being second only in accuracy to the academic German-Latin text published by Richard Schmidt in 1897.
the above said objectives don not obey the attitude of their life
It is wrong to assume kamasutra as mechanical romantic book.
