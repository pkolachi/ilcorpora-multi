Question: Can gobar gas be generated again from the gobar gas slurry? Answer: Gobar gas can be generated from the slurry that comes out from the gobar gas plant. This slurry should be mixed with dung in the proportion of 25 to 50 per cent of the dung and then water should be added to it in a proper proportion. This mixture should contain water and solid matter in the proportion 1:1. The mixture should be passed in the gobar gas plant. If the slurry is passed in excess in the gobar gas plant, the acidity increases and the gobar gas may generate in lesser quantity.
