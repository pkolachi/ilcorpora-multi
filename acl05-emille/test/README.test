TEST DATA FOR THE ENGLISH-HINDI WORD ALIGNMENT TASK


Data
----
The test set for English-Hindi task consists of 90 sentences. See the
"Guidelines" for details regarding the annotation scheme.

File Naming Conventions
-----------------------
There is one pair of files containing the sentence aligned test texts, 
with the Hindi texts carrying the .h extension, and the English texts 
carrying the .e extension. 

Source and target language
-------------------------
For this task, English is the source language, and Hindi is the target
language. Therefore, in a word alignment line:
sentence_no position_L1 position_L2 [S|P] [confidence]

position_L1 represents the position of the word within the English sentence, 
position_L2 represents the position of the word within the Hindi sentence,

[the first word in a sentence is at position 1]

Other
-----
1. An alignment has to be provided for each word in the test files. If a word
does not appear in any alignment, we assume by default a NULL alignment for 
that word.
