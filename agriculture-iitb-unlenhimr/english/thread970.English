Question: The brinjal is affected by tip borer. So, please give me a proper guidance.Now, the plants have budded.Medicine used: NuclearFertilizer used: Per acre, 10 trailers of farm yard manure Answer: You have said that you have used many medicines to control the maggot that bores the tip and fruit of brinjal. But it was not controlled as desired. Your brinjal crop is 5 months old. Therefore, it is possible that it is affected by a pest to some extent. So, use 2 light traps per acre to control the pest. Also, remove all the rotten fruits and tips and destroy them. Later, spray a chemical medicine a few times. Use the medicines alternately at every spraying. Between two consecutive sprayings, spray 5 percent neem seed extract (5 Kg neem seed powder / 1000 litre water). Every time, use a sticky solution in the solution for spraying. The spraying should be done either in the morning or in the evening. In this way, control the pest. Prepare a light trap as shown in the picture below and place it in the crop.Question: The brinjal is affected by tip borer.So, please give me a proper guidance.Now, the plants have budded.Medicine used: NuclearFertilizer used: Per acre, 10 trailers of farm yard manure Answer: You have said that you have used many medicines to control the maggot that bores the tip and fruit of brinjal.But it was not controlled as desired.Your brinjal crop is 5 months old.Therefore, it is possible that it is affected by a pest to some extent.So, use 2 light traps per acre to control the pest.Also, remove all the rotten fruits and tips and destroy them.Later, spray a chemical medicine a few times.Use the medicines alternately at every spraying.Between two consecutive sprayings, spray 5 percent neem seed extract (5 Kg neem seed powder / 1000 litre water).Every time, use a sticky solution in the solution for spraying.The spraying should be done either in the morning or in the evening.In this way, control the pest.Prepare a light trap as shown in the picture below and place it in the crop.
