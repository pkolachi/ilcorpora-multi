Grapes turn dry 
During the season of grapes, bunches of grapes turn dry and appear to be affected by blackarm. 
Please suggest a remedy for this.
Bunches of grapes dry and drop if sap-sucking pest has spread excessively or if the plant has caught blackarm. 
To control the sap-sucking pest, spray once or twice the solution of 20 ml Roger with 10 litre of water, 13 ml Chloropyriphos with 10 litre of water or 10 ml Quinolphos with 10 litre of water. 
In case of fungicides, for controlling fungus, spray the solution of 20 - 25 gm of fungicide containing sulphur with 10 litre of water or Belton water.
For Mosaic, 10 - 12 gm Ridomil with 10 litre of water, and for blackarm, 25 gm Carbondizim with 10 litre of water or 20 gm Benlet with 10 litre of water should be sprayed alternatively 2 - 3 times.
Feed the grape vine properly.
