Phanerogamic parasites on mango tree 
The mango trees have become 24 - 25 years old and their branches have been affected by phanerogamic parasites.
Due to this,their ability to bear fruit has become very low.
As almost all the branches have been affected by the phanerogamic parasites it is not practical to cut them.
So please suggest a remedy to maintain their proper growth and to enable them bear as many fruits as possible.
To let the phanerogamic parasites to grow would not prove beneficial for the plant, hence they should be cut every now and then so that they do not grow.
A tree with the phanerogamic parasite on it, will not give a satisfactory yield even if large quantities of fertilizers are used.
