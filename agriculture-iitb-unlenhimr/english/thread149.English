Red marigold bears yellow flowers 
Our Marigold plants have borne both red and yellow flowers on the same branch. 
However, the plants planted had red flowers and the seedlings for the red flower plants were made at home itself. 
Out of the flowers produced 99 per cent are yellow and yellow flowers fetch a very low market price. 
Why does this happen and what is the remedy for this?
The seeds might be adultrated; so get it tested. 
Also, get the soil-examination done and give the doses of fertilizers accordingly.
