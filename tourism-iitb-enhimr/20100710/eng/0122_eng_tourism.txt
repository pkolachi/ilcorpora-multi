French_43042600  settlement_11236412  of Florida_18941523  began_22583241  in 1562  as Huguenots_110038859 , French_43042600  Protestants_19541025 , established_22403508  themselves on the St._Johns_River_19284640  not_324548  far_4465890  from the Spanish_43042784  settlement_18113205  at St._Augustine_18944622 . 
Britain_18733354  gained_22270580  control_15135074  of Florida_18941523  in 1763  in exchange_11151051  for Havana_18627682 , Cuba_18627240 , which the British_19590934  had captured_22251177  from Spain_18894294  during the Seven Years’ War_21082458  (1756 –63 ). 
Spain_18894294  evacuated_21839037  Florida_18941523  after the exchange_11151051 , leaving_21991207  the province_18533584  virtually_373379  empty_41128234 .
At that time_17209466 , St._Augustine_18944622  was_22579744  still_332017  a garrison_13384021  community_18110535  with fewer_41612560  than five_hundred_42274891  houses_13505558  and Pensacola_18944384  also_347757  was_22579744  a small_41443454  military_41572552  town_18544709 .
First_3103443 , it was split_22443783  into two_42262856  parts_113628130 : East_4861485  Florida_18941523 , with its capital_18400383  at St._Augustine_18944622 ; and West_4862456  Florida_18941523 , with its seat_18527185  at Pensacola_18944384  and the Apalachicola_River_19068674  became_2147020  the boundary_18394362  between them.
The two_42262856  Floridas remained_22703136  loyal_41000865  to Great_Britain_18733354  throughout the War_of_American_Independence_11286190  (1776 83 ).
In 1783 , Spain_18894294  regained_22226903  control_15135074  of the rest_113629800  of Florida_18941523  as part_113628130  of the peace_treaty_16683201  that ended_2348855  the American_Revolution_11286190 .
Americans_19596828  joined_22411351  the battles_1939655  for Florida_18941523  in 1803 , following_22696027  their purchase_176895  of Louisiana_18960203  from the French_19591258 .
The history_114922667  of Florida_18941523  during this period_114914858  is_22579744  one of territorial_42897733  gain_113573168  and loss_113156162  until 1821 , when Spain_18894294  ceded_22294666  Florida_18941523  to the United_States_of_America_18915715 .
When the British_19590934  evacuated_21839037  Florida_18941523 , Spanish_43042784  colonists_110424429  as well as settlers_110424429  from the newly_3113589  formed_42220059  United_States_18915715  came_21831864  pouring_22010114  in_3504959 .

Instead_363479  of becoming_2147020  more_3100048  Spanish_43042784 , Florida_18941523  increasingly_360161  became_2147020  more_3100048  "American_43011995 ."
Finally_348228 , after several_42344948  official_41691258  and unofficial_41692312  U.S._18241459  military_expeditions_1954566  into the territory_18375896 , Spain_18894294  formally_3187836  ceded_22294666  Florida_18941523  to the

What the U.S._18241459  inherited_22293955  was_22579744  a wilderness_18562488  sparsely_3465882  dotted_22664089  with settlements_18113205  of native_41074696  Indian_43012477  people_17834515 , African_Americans_19499537  and Spaniards_19590314 .
As a territory_18375896  of the United_States_18915715 , Florida_18941523  was particularly_384750  attractive_4191232  to people_17834515  from the older_41697790  Southern_41664951  plantation_113082018  areas_18379933  of Virginia_19017490 , the Carolinas_18922971  and Georgia_18945623 , who arrived_21987643  in considerable_4655815  numbers_15061203 .
After territorial_42897733  status_113759811  was granted_22234353 , the two_42262856  Floridas were merged_2363663  into one_42262724  entity_11740  with a new_42141686  capital_18400383  city_18406385  in Tallahassee_18944958 .
As Florida_18941523 ’s population_18066746  increased_2153864  through immigration_154399 , so_3148459  did pressure_114284392  on the federal_government_17942926  to remove_22381337  the Indian_43012477  people_17834515  from their lands_18437765 .

Beginning_2341793  in the 1870 s, residents_110365629  from northern_41659648  states_18533584  visited_22463694  Florida_18941523  as tourists_110557758  to enjoy_21803158  the state_18533584 ’s natural_41628875  beauty_14628402  and mild_41563266  climate_114326654
