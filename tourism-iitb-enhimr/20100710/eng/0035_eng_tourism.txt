 :18 : The tradition_15597282  of pyramid_13983893  building_1897937  started_2341793  in Ancient_41790574  Egypt_18769320  as a sophistication of the idea_15906705  of a mastaba_13685849  or "platform_13917097 " covering_21320932  the royal_41649901  tomb_13418251

 :22 : The site_18530506  was first_3103443  prepared_2401967  and blocks_12824782  of stone_19281147  were transported_21935747  and placed_21481373

 :27 : A second_42278352  theory_15814280  suggests_2921281  that the blocks_12824782  were placed_21481373  using_21147708  long_41486034  levers_13619067  with a short_41488508  angled_42118856  foot
