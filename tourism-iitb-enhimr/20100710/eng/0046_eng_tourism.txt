The next_4145998  great_41327056  king_110078740  was_22579744  Praversein II in whose time_114923492  people_17834515  enjoyed_21181288  perfect_41812363  peace_114346806  and prosperity_114281368 .
He was_22579744  a great_41327056  conqueror_19809117  who extended_2535553  the boundaries_18394362  of the state_18533584  in all_42345966  directions_18558976 .
 He has made_2118050  his name_16248892  immortal_41613829  by founding_1236350  the city_18406385  of Praverseinpura (modern_41590811  city_18406385  of Srinagar), the summer_115038062  capital_18400383  of the state_18533584  at_present_349572 . 
Praversein ruled_22561860  ably_3186516  for 60_42268462  years_115004692  and is_22579744  supposed_4968933  to have directly_352235  ascended_21950977  to heaven_15558236  while worshipping_21761986   Lord_9399300  Shiva_19391994  in his temple_14355393  'Pravesha', now_348812  standing_22710162  in ruins_114369409  near HariParbat fort_13350250 .
It was_22579744  during the time_114923492  of first_42278253  king_110078740  of Karkota dynasty_17863397 , Durlabvardhan, that the orate_2820071  Chinese_43048539  pilgrim_110276789 , HienTsang visited_22463694  Kashmir and entered_21998301  the valley_19332728  via Varahmulla where he found_22134693  a huge_41439559  stone_114502966  gate_13390689 . 
The entry_147327  of all_42345966  outsiders_19953738 , except the Hindus_19546194 , was_22579744  banned_41454027  in the state_18533584  then_3119035 . 
 He stayed_21839979  in Kashmir for nearly_373379  two_42262856  years_115004692 , studied_2636835  Sanskrit_16874904  and Hindu_43008389  scriptures_16344563  at the feet_15493969  of learned_42155423  men_110133569  here_3109485 .
 It is_22579744  the Karkota dynasty_17863397  that has given_22294885  Kashmir the greatest_41327056  ruler_110383195  Lalitaditya Muktapid (724  761  A.D._31837 ). 
He is_22579744  undoubtedly_379508  the Samudra Gupta of Kashmir.
He was_22579744  filled_41126333  with an unquenchable_42149854  thirst_14889485  for world_19138104  conquest_186727 . 
The Punjab, Kanuj, Tibet_18779280 , Ladhak, Badakshan, Iran_18782971 , Bihar_18777439 , Gauda (Bengal_18588688 ) Kalinga (Orissa_18778400 ), South_41660681  India_18772979 , Gujarat_18777667 , Malwa, Marwar and Sindh were_22579744  all_38032  conquered_2457163  by him. 
It was_22579744  he, who finally_348228  broke_2360042  the power_15129563  of Arabs_19588064  in Sindh. 
All these unbroken_4313439  victories_17371509  created_21738395  a feeling_125099  of pride_17406373  among the people_17834515  here_3109485  and his victories_17371509  came_2536727  to be celebrated_22466998  in a big_41434452  way_14873611 . 
Kalhan who wrote_21683134  his famous_41426596  chronicle_16427477  (Rajatarangini) nearly_373379  four_42263051  hundred_42272367  years_115004692  after the death_17254694  of Lalitaditya, records_2990286  that even_317488  in his time_114923492  the victories_17371509  of the great_41327056  victor_110592214  were being celebrated_22466998  throughout the valley_19332728 . 
Alberuni, who accompanied_22007298  Mahmud Gaznavi in his Indian_43012740  campaigns_1954242 , specifically_341621  mentions_21014090  in his book_16325082  (TahqiqiHind) that Kashmiris_19537714  observed_22553734  second_42278352  of Chaitra, as the day_114958185  of victory_17371509 .
 Lalitaditya was_22579744  equally_322606  a great_41327056  builder_19733015  and he built_21639788  his capital_18400383  near the sacred_42124780  shrine_14161359  of KhirBhawani, and gave_22294885  it the name_16248892  of Parihaspur (city_18406385  of pleasure_17388600 ). 
Throughout the valley_19332728 , he built_21639788  very_332750  fine_4888945  and massive_41441291  temples_14355393 , out of which the world_19138104  famous_41426596  sun_19314641  temple_14355393  (Martand) built_21639788  on Mattan Karewa, reminds_2602924  us about the grandeur_14758829  and splendor_14899047  of the times_114921746  when their builder_19733015  ruled_22561860  the state_18533584 .
 The extensive_41438492  ruins_14072726  of his capital_18400383  city_18406385  Parihaspur,  speak  of his activities_1403481  in the field_114321345  of art_12718021  and architecture_12709284 . 
After his death_17254694 , it is_22579744  mostly_36130  the weak_41893771  rulers_110383195  except his grandson_19992356  Jayatida, who ruled_22561860  the valley_19332728 . 
Both_42344813  Lalitaditya, and Jayatida were_22579744  great_41327056  patrons_110252611  of learning_15681825  and extended_22276292  their patronage_11198617  to Bhavabhuti, Vakpatrija, Udhata Bhata, Damodhar Gupta, Manoratha, Sankhdanta, Samadhimat, etc._3104379 . 
The history_114922667  of Karkota dynasty_17863397  after Jayatida is_22579744  a 
sad_41171857  story_16427477  of decline_113284393 . 
All the conquered_21103448  territories_18375896  regained_22226903  their independence_113808065 , and the sovereignty_114251818  of the ruler_110383195  of Kashmir came_2536727  to be confined_2232312  to Vitasta basin_18401289 . 
The economic_42803023  ruin_114369409  was hastened_21629828  by the extravagant_42070783  habits_1410053  of both_42344813  the rulers_110383195  and the ministers_110166677 .
 In the words_17012171  of Kalhan : " the ministers_110166677  and the grandees_19991399  carried_off_21421807  the revenues_113091403  of the country_18426193 , feasted_21170913  in mutual_42229702  jealousy_17447491  on the masterless_4631993  kingdom_18471307 , like wolves_12093478  on a dead_4102439  buffalo_12385771  in a desert_18387780 ." 
 Laments_21785050  Dr. P. C. Ray that “never_321234  before the Karkota period_115096136 , had Kashmir performed_21697549  such_41610028  a feat_134896 , nor was_22579744  she able_41740  to repeat_21719256  it in future_114922886 ."
In spite of this, the entire_4541797  Karkota rule_115094644  on_the_whole_3152961  has been considered_2682517  as the glorious_41959635  and remarkable_42240824  periods_115096136  of ancient_41704353  Kashmir.
It was_22579744  round about_37040  in 855 56  A.D._31837  that Karkota rule_115094644  ended_22584658 , and a new_42141686  Utpal dynasty_17863397  assumed_22358785  power_15129563  in Kashmir. 
The most_3112597  important_41323836  ruler_110383195  of this dynasty_17863397  was_22579744  Maharaja_110128048  Avanti Varman. 
It was_22579744  he, who recovered_22226903  Kashmir from utter_41574257  political_41878927  and economic_42803023  disorder_113866201 .
His reign_115060366  witnessed_22109242  a period_114914858  of peace_113784195  and consolidation_11221778  and prosperity_114281368 .
 It was_22579744  during this time_114923492 , that the valley_19332728  rose_21951540  to great_41327056  heights_113754402  in the realm_15921586  of philosophy_16077243 , art_12718021  and letters_15681703 . 
There was_22579744  an outburst_16918182  of literary_42915835  activity_1403481  on a grand_41332746  scale_113634288 , and eminent_41326247  men_110133569  Kallata Bhat sura, Ratnakar, Anandavardhana, Muktakana, SivaSwamin, Rudrata and Mukula. 
Kalhan's mention_16675415  of numerous_41608276  temples_14355393  built_21639788  and towns_18544709  founded_22403508  by the king_110078740  and his ministers_110166677  throws_21049759  plenty_15055281  of light_15736241  on the prosperous_41195516  condition_113735349  of the period_115096136 .
 :34 : The most_3112597  important_41323836  foundation_1236350  of the king_110078740  was_22579744  his capital_18400383  city_18406385  of Avantipur, which he embellished_21660856  with two_42262856  temples_14355393 ,  one dedicated_4603497  to Shiva_19391994  and the other to Vishnu_19393240 . 
Both of them are_22579744  in ruins_113293077  now_348812 , but even_317488  then_3119164 , they stand_22710162  as the most_3112597  imposing_41331710  monuments_13702493  of ancient_41704353  Kashmir.
The reign_115060366  of this king_110078740  would not_324548  be_22579744  complete_41813329  without the mention_16675415  of 'Suya' one of the greatest_41327056  engineers_19479363  Kashmir produced_21737491  in ancient_41704353  times_114921746 . 
For centuries_115006433  the people_17834515  of the valley_19332728  had been suffering_22089672  from the recurring_4624039  curse_17319375  of famines_17215591  and floods_111289656 . 
Suya correctly_3205516  assessed_2673425  that these frequent_41107882  calamities_17214657  occurred_2336141  due_to_4192257  heavy_41237334  rains_111335193  and excessive_41589076  water_17828101  of Vitasta river_19276541  which could not_324548  easily_3149063  get_out_21997376  with swiftness_14999076  through a gorge_19157434  near Varahmulla, as the compressed_41715449  passage_15185613  there got_2147020  badly_315978  blocked_21466474  with silt_114844192  and huge_41439559  boulders_19095493 . 
The people_17834515  removed_2170552  both the silt_114844192  and stones_19281147  when the great_41327056  engineer_19479363  threw_21495454  plenty_15055281  of gold_114444880  and silver_114461017  coins_113215857  into the river_19276541  at many_41607490  places_18543623 .
Thousands_113569755  of starving_42378548  people_17834515  immediately_349076  jumped_21072220  into the flooded_41125443  Vitasta and in order to find_22264084  the coins_113215857  cleared_41338074  the bed_19085476  of the rocks_19281147  and boulders_19095493  which had choked_up_21466474  the passage_15185613 .
Suya, then_3118752  raised_21646259  stone_114502966  embankments_13247538  and adopted_22324518  other_42140352  protective_41953804  measures_1170956 . 
Many_41607490  canals_12918793  were dug_out_21299489  to increase_2150700  the  irrigational  facilities_1579981 .
 The result_111246064  of all_42345966  these measures_1170956  was_22579744  that a great_41439123  stretch_19313423  of land_19201202  became_2147020  available_4203394  for cultivation_1902693 . 
The production_1900578  of paddy_17698879  increased_2153864  and the price_113132137  of one_42262724  Khirwar (nearly_373379  two_42262856  maunds_113538033 ) came_down_21952509  to 36_42266179   Dinars  from 200_42274562   Dinars .
Suya's memory_15859637  is still_332017  preserved_22258588  to this day_114924376  by the town_18544709  of Sayapur (Sopore), founded_22403508  by him at the point_18499788  where river_19276541  Vitasta, since his regulation_1793467 , leaves_21997376  the basin_19083308  of Mahapadomsar (Wular lake_19194880 ).
Avanti Varman died_2354455  in a temple_14355393  on the Dal Lake_19194880 , when a fatal_41033404  disease_113883821  caught_287150  him, and in the words_17012171  of Kalhan, “listening_22150157  to the end_114370045  to the song_16951212  of the  Lord_9399300  (Bhagavad_Gita_16345334 ) and thinking_21622668  of the residence_14033360  of Vishnu_19393240  (Vaikuntha) he cast_off_21500517  his earthly_41227403  life_113777175  with a cheerful_4385574  mind_15541806 . 
In the time_114923492  of King_110078740  Yasakara (939 48 ) a 'Math' (hospice_13501674 ) was built_21639788  for the students_110505881  of India_18772979 , who came_21831864  to Kashmir for study_15685146  and meditation_15715053 .
It clearly_339880  reveals_22124270  intimate_4477016  cultural_42983701  contact_137654  between the valley_19332728  and the plains_19258805  of India_18772979  in the 10 th_42279525  century_115006433 . 
In 950 , Khemgupta ascended_22358630  the throne_14376862  of Kashmir, a man_110133569  of mediocre_41734512  ability_15546715  who married_22464955  princess_110317446  Didda, daughter_19844392  of the ruler_110383195  of Lohara (Poonch) and granddaughter_19990841  of the Shahi king_110078740  of Kabul_18582433 .
After the decline_114230826  of the Utpala dynasty_17863397 , Lohara dynasty_17863397  ruled_22561860  Kashmir till the end_115066306  of the Hindu_43008389  rule_114251219  in Kashmir (1339 ). 
Queen_110342823  Didda was_22579744  the de_facto_4729643  ruler_110383195  of the state_18533584 , as she was_22579744  very_332750  dominating_4825706  and exercised_21154970  immense_41439559  influence_15132928  over her husband_110041644 . 
She built_21639788  many_41607490  temples_14355393  and  monasteries_13739716  and one of these was reserved_2715856  for the people_18048773  of Madyadesha and Lata ( U.P._8778000 , Bihar_18777439  and Central_43023930  India_18772979 ).
 Before her, two_42262856  other_42140352  queens_110342823  had ruled_22561860  Kashmir, namely_3189873  Yashovati and Sugandha.
She died_2354455  in 1003  A.D._31837  and left_22208351  the throne_14376862  of Kashmir to her family_17968033  in undisputed_4634081  succession_180631 . 
As her children_19771320  had died_2354455  young_41706638 , she transmitted_22210942  the crown_16791707  to Sangramraj, son_110464570  of her brother_19730910  Udairaj, the ruler_110383195  of Lohara (Poonch).
It was_22579744  during her time_114923492  that Mahmud Gaznavi twice_365621  tried_22505947  to capture_22251177  the valley_19332728  but the fort_13350250  at Lohara, remarkable_42240824  for its height_15076538  and strength_14976345  proved_22608499  impregnable_42609394 .
From 1089  to 1101  A.D._31837 , King_110078740  Harsha ruled_22561860  Kashmir.
 Versed_4975742  in many_41607490  languages_16199918 , a good_41168164  poet_110288082 , lover_19927818  of music_16924703  and art_12718021 , he started_2341793  his rule_114251219  in a remarkable_41739928  way_14873611 , and became_2147020  famous_41426596  in northern_41659648  India_18772979 . 
His court_13089047  was_22579744  a centre_18396101  of luxury_114299753  and splendor_14758829 . 
He introduced_21627743  new_42141686  fashions_14873611  in dress_12730251  and ornaments_13137079 . 
His ministers_110166677  were gorgeously_3352163  dressed_243182 , wore_251608  earrings_13228234  and head_dresses_13464546 , previously_360939  reserved_42057593  for the members_110153551  of ruling_41892961  families_17968033  only_38625 . 
But  strangely enough , Harsha's career_1278838  became_2147020  a record_16548273  of follies_11232189  and misdeeds_1724723 .
The people_17834515  also_347757  suffered_22089672  from famine_17215591 , and plague_113950339  as_well_347757 , and a considerable_4655815  section_18527581  of people_17834515  became_2147020  victims_110591377  of these calamities_17214657 . 
Harsha along with his son_110464570  Bhoja were murdered_22458546 , and the Kashmir throne_14376862  passed_22208846  into the hands_1806811  of two_42262856  princes_110316181  respectively_3138726 . 
Both_42344813  the princes_110316181  met_22090537  the fate_114280538  of Harsha and when our great_41327056  historian_110025385  Kalhan completed_2479055  his 'Rajatarangini' in 1149   50  King_110078740  Jaisimha, the last_41053326  great_41327056  ruler_110383195  of the Hindu_43008389  times_114921746  was ruling_22561860  the state_18533584 .
The King_110078740  repaired_2257338  and restored_2257338  many_41607490  temples_14355393  and shrines_14161359 , and numerous_41608276  other_42140352  pious_41844056  foundations_18292161  were also_347757  made_21607166  during his reign_115060366 . 
The people_17834515  after a long_41490468  time_114923492  heaved_2976860  a sigh_17031614  of relief_17391167 . 
From 1155   1339 , the Kashmir rulers_110383195  remained_2115825  busy_4315003  only_34711  in intrigues_15833651 , debauchery_1506039  and mutual_42015219  quarrels_17085589 . 
 :69 : These incessant_4623017  feuds_11220536 , civil_wars_1948654 , risings_1948216  and upheavals_113793341  greatly_356928  weakened_2221826  Hindu_19546194  domination_11113129  of Kashmir. 
The valley_19332728  soon_334685  fell_2145401  prey_110313829  to Mongol_43166818  and Turkish_43105969  raiders_110287058 , freebooters_110287058  and foreign_41075157  adventurers_19469770 . 
The Kabul_18582433  valley_19332728  Proutonsa (Poonch), Pajapuri (Rajauri) Kangra, Jammu, Kisthwar and Ladhak, one after the other threwoff_21500517  their allegiance_14822704  to the rulers_110383195  of Kashmir.
Like Taimur in the Punjab and Delhi_18775588 , Dulucha carried_21437285  sword_14322100  and fire_113307342 , destroyed_21605540  towns_18544709  and villages_18551779  and slaughtered_2474158  thousands. 
A weak_41893771  and worthless_42585994  man_110133569  Raja_110348497  Sahadev was_22579744  the ruler_110383195  then_3119035 .
 It was_22579744  during his reign_115060366  that three_42262966  adventurers_19922987 , Shah Mir from Swat (Tribal_43155222 ) territory_18375896  on the borders_18394839  of Afghanistan_18581650 , Rinchin from Ladhak, and Lankar Chak from Dard territory_18375896  near Gilgit came_21831864  to Kashmir, and played_22347932  a notable_42672288  role_1709615  in subsequent_4141133  political_41878927  history_114922667  of the valley_19332728 . 
The last_41053326  Hindu_43008389  ruler_110383195  of Kashmir was_22579744  Udyan Dev. 
It was_22579744  his chief_41325646  queen_110342823  Kota Rani_110349388 , who practically_323304  governed_22561860  the state_18533584 . 
The valley_19332728  was again_341086  invaded_21115596  by a Mongol_43166818  and Turk_19593168  invader_110061553  Achalla, but the queen_110342823  defeated_21097222  him, and drove_away_21984477  all_42345966  the foreign_41075157  troops_18282713 . 
In the confusion_113789729  Rinchin, the Ladhaki prince_110316181 , whom the Hindu_43008389  religious_42126735  leaders_19485967  of the time_114923492  refused_22478773  to admit_22478434  into their fold_17883117 , organized_2701906  an internal_41078943  rising_1948216  and seized_21202294  the throne_1599598 
Before switching_over_2138337  to the early_4851244  Muslim_43008190  period_115096136 , it would be_22579744  proper_41945146  to point_out_21048016 , very_332750  briefly_3291397  of_course_339495 , the contribution_1775927  of people_17834515  here_3109485 , in the field_15920396  of philosophy_16077243 , literature_16279095  and archaeology_16063119 .
In the field_15920396  of philosophy_16077243  Kashmir's contribution_1775927  is_22579744  the "Shiva_19391994  School_of_thought_15867837 ", which assumed_2519348  a distinctive_4380662  character_15776237  in the valley_19332728 . 
Shiva_19391994  is_22579744  another_42141203  name_16248892  for independence_113808065 , and the only_38625  reality_113769426  of the universe_19330440  is_22579744  Shiva_19391994  who is_22579744  infinite_41047545  consciousness_15605015  and unrestricted_42072629  independence_113808065 . 
He has_22182934  many_41607490  other_42140352  features_15776742  like omnipresence_113772421 , eternity_113770870  and  formlessness , though independence_113808065  is_22579744  peculiar_41146622  to him. 
The three_42262966  great_41327056  Acharyas of this school_18161401  are_22579744  Vasugupta, Kallatha and the great_41327056  Abhinavagupta. 
Hundreds_113569316  of other_42140352  Kashmiri_43158270  philosophers_110268081  and thinkers_110547882  wrote_21683134  masterpieces_13686351  on this philosophy_15867837  in the subsequent_4141133  periods_115096136  of our history_114922667 
 :84 :  It was_22579744  Vasumitra and Nagarjuna who gave_22179176  shape_15865701  and form_15855685  to this new_42141686  school_of_thought_15867837 . 
Nagarjuna, in the words_17012171  of Havell, was_22579744  the Luther_110982335  of Buddhism_17988637 , the apostle_19655628  of Bhakti_11028744  marga, who would find_21623484  means_1169254  of expression_17041749  for the deep_seated_41694675  religious_42126735  instinct_15553174  of the masses_18067057 , through the way_1169254  of devotion_17441932  to the divine_41226254  teacher_110533902 , rather than through the dry_42384789  agnostic_42689261  philosophy_15867837  of Hinayana_17989404  School_18161401 . 
This creed_15883917  became_2147020  very_332750  popular_41880320  in China_18600800 , Japan_18792630 , Tibet_18779280  and Ladakh. 
 :86 : Nagarjuna has been raised_2539156  to the exalted_41646384  position_113759811  of Boddhisatva_19395626  and enjoys_21181288  the reputation_114246429  of being_22579744  the greatest_41327056  thinker_110547882  of the age_115054535 . 
In the field_15920396  of literature_16279095 , there is_22579744  hardly_32938  any_42344366  branch_18286706  of learning_15681825  which the people_18048773  of Kashmir had not_324548  studied_2636835 , and to which they did not_324548  make_2118050  their own_41831352  original_41919217  contribution_1775927 . 
In philosophy_16077243 , religion_17971667 , medicine_1606716 , astronomy_16015205 , literature_16279095 , engineering_1935733 , sculpture_1923979 , architecture_16043371 , painting_13833092 , music_16924703 , dancing_1423640  and in many_41607490  other_42140352  walks_of_life_1578823  the progress_1245749  of Kashmiris_19537714  during the ancient_41704353  times_114921746  is_22579744  astonishing_42440056  and striking_4611005 .
In the words_17012171  of Grieson, "for upwards_397343  of two_42262856  thousand_113569755  years_115004692 , Kashmir has been_22579744  the home_18465207  of Sanskrit_16874904  learning_15681825  and from this small_41443454  valley_19332728  has issued_2523638  masterpieces_13686351  of history_16074588 , poetry_16995243 , romance_16285720 , fable_16286548  and philosophy_16077243 . 
Kashmiris_19537714  are_22579744  justly_3206840  proud_41956590  of the literary_42915835  glories_114245420  of their land_18437765 .
For centuries_115006433  Kashmir was_22579744  the house_13505558  of the greatest_42422742  Sanskrit_16874904  scholars_110399521 , and at_least_3105376  one_42262724  great_41327056  Indian_43012740  religion_17971667  of 'Shaivism' has found_22109242  some of its most_3112597  eloquent_4170216  teachers_110533902  on the banks_19081442  of the Vitasta.
 Some of the greatest_42422742  Sanskrit_16874904  scholars_110399521  and poets_110288082  were_22579744  born_41795551 , and wrote_21683134  in the valley_19332728  and from it has issued_2523638  in Sanskrit_16874904  language_16199918  a world_19138104  famous_41426596  collection_16503899  of folklore_15909378 "   (the Panchatantra.)
In the domain_15921586  of architecture_16043371 , the charm_14631954  of Kashmir, apart from its magnificent_41333578  natural_41628875  scenery_18526027 , lies_22707064  in its temples_14355393  and fine_arts_12718021 .
 Wrote_2983252  one_42262724  European_43051818  art_critic_19666249 : "Ancient_41704353  India_18772979  has_22182934  nothing_13037  more_3100048  worthy_42669830  of its civilization_113276165 , than the grand_41439389  remains_19272458  in Kashmir, the massive_41441291 , the grotesque_41007171 , the elegant_4888119  in architecture_12709284 , may be admired_22144995  in many_41607490  parts_18509674  of India_18772979 , but nowhere_326125  is to be seen_22109658 , the counterparts_13085946  of the  classically  graceful_41184503 , yet symmetrically_3176942  massive_41441291  edifices_12884748  of Kashmir, and in beauty_14628402 , and position_113759811  are_22579744  immensely_35804  superior_42420512 .” 
The best_3189500  preserved_4774616  of these stone_114502966  temples_14355393  are_22629830  at Martand and Avantipur. 
The Martand temple_14355393  has been universally_3196865  admired_22144995  by the archeologists_19660350  and the artists_19667719 . 
Writes_2983252  Stein: “It is_22579744  no_longer_332228  possible_41886604  to trace_2720779 , with certainty_15626789 , the cities_18406385  and remains_19272458  of all_42345966  the towns_18544709  and structures_14290445  which owed_22707488  their existence_113768200  to Lalitaditya. 
But those among them which can be identified_2611084  justly_3206840  by their extant_4967038  ruins_14072726 , the great_41327056  fame_114245690  which Lalitaditya enjoyed_21181288  as a builder_19732731 . 
The ruins_14072726  of the splendid_4240074  temple_14355393  of Martand which the king_110078740  had constructed_21639788  near the 'Tirtha' of the same_42139473  name_16248892  are_22579744  still_332017  the most_3112597  striking_4611005  object_13122  of ancient_41704353  Hindu_43008389  architecture_12709284  in the valley_19332728 . 
Even_317488  in their present_41793279  state_123591  of decay_113283730 , they command_2743102  admiration_17398628  both by their imposing_41331710  dimensions_15033819  and by the beauty_14628402  of their architectural_42982619  design_13146836  and decoration_1258479 ."
No one without an eye_15544945  for natural_41628875  beauty_14628402  would have chosen_2666555  that special_41146622  site_18530506  for the construction_1897937  of a temple_14355393 , and no one with an inclination_16114896  to the ephemeral_41819035  and transient_41819035  world_19138104  have built_21639788  it, on so_3147781  massive_41441572  and enduring_41817634  a scale_113634288 .
Thus_342866  Lalitaditya must be regarded_2682517  as the founder_19957085  not_only_325615  of a shortlived_41819035  empire_18438774 , but also_347757  of six_42263219  centuries_115006433  of Kashmiri_43158270  Hindu_43008389  art_12718021 . "
