The city_18406385  thrived_2306614  commercially_377898  and had_22182934  strong_41567822  economic_42803023  ties_113744365  with their main_41325646  ally_18192006 , Ptolemy_I_111083952  Soter of Egypt_18769320 . 
In 305  BC_32142 , the  Antigonids  of Macedonia_18787625  who were_22579744  also_347757  rivals_110375015  of the Ptolemies_18045668 , besieged_21116611  Rhodes_18659993  in an attempt_1774657  to break_17213615  the  RhodoEgyptian  alliance_16682909 . 
When a peace_16683201  agreement_16679500  was reached_22501902  in 304  BC_32142 , the  Antagonids  lifted_2791256  the siege_11060783 , leaving_2606030  a wealth_15055841  of military_41572552  equipment_13259073  behind_3223763 . 
To celebrate_22466998  their unity_14687765 , the  Rhodians  sold_22221378  the equipment_13259073  and used_21147708  the money_113212169  to erect_21646259  an enormous_41437585  statue_14255435  of their sun_god_19370365 , Helios_19424520 . 
The construction_1897937  of the  Colossus_3042144  took_22246711  12_42263833  years_115004692  and was finished_2479055  in 282  BC_32142 . 
For years_115043767 , the statue_14255435  stood_22710162  at the harbor_18518519  entrance_13255837 , until a strong_42399006  earthquake_17327609  hit_21197815  Rhodes_18659993  about_37040  226  BC_32142 . 
 :6 : The city_18406385  was badly_315978  damaged_4713387  and the  Colossus_3042144  was broken_2330513  at its weakest_42402394  point_18499788   the knee_15504248 .
The  Rhodians  received_22189688  an immediate_4472721  offer_17065923  from Ptolemy III Eurgetes of Egypt_18769320  to cover_22650140  all_42345966  restoration_1264787  costs_113104779  for the toppled_21958171  monument_13702493 . 
They disassembled_21642993  the remains_19272458  of the broken_4311599   Colossus_3042144  and sold_22221378  them to a Jew_19543023  from Syria_18904301 . 
It is said_21005919  that the fragments_19152256  had to be transported_21935747  to Syria_18904301  on the backs_15489509  of 900  camels_12414816 . 
 It has long_3167309  been believed_2675183  that the  Colossus_3042144  stood_22710162  in front of the Mandraki harbor_18518519 , one of many_41607490  in the city_18406385  of Rhodes_18659993 , straddling_22664591  its entrance_13255837 . 
Given_430187  the height_15076538  of the statue_14255435  and the width_15075523  of the harbor_18518519  mouth_19228060 , this picture_15861281  is_22579744  rather_399421  impossible_41888646  than improbable_41465532 . 
Moreover_330080 , the fallen_42576590   Colossus_3042144  would have blocked_21465161  the harbor_18518519  entrance_13255837 .
 Recent_41701904  studies_1638033  suggest_2921281  that it was erected_21646259  either on the eastern_4862106  promontory_19264627  of the Mandraki harbor_18518519 , or even_317682  further_330352  inland_3259190 . 
The project_1784188  was commissioned_22456924  by the  Rhodian  sculptor_110407637  Chares of Lindos.
 To build_21639788  the statue_14255435 , his workers_19495263  cast_21647787  the outer_4987886  bronze_114523408  skin_15175953  parts_13849293 . 
The base_13351237  was made_21639033  of white_4415382  marble_114751070  and the feet_15493969  and ankle_15509088  of the statue_14255435  were first_3103443  fixed_2481887 . 
The structure_14290445  was gradually_3108993  erected_21646259  as the bronze_114523408  form_15155456  was fortified_2217868  with an iron_114448480  and stone_114502966  framework_13355477 . 
To reach_22659879  the higher_41250892  parts_13849293 , an earth_114647495  ramp_14006021  was built_21639788  around the statue_14255435  and was later_361510  removed_2170552 . 
When the  Colossus_3042144  was finished_2479055 , it stood_22676321  about_37040  33_42265883  m_113479010  (110_42272699  ft_113470146 ) high_41250892 . 
And when it fell_21953981 , "few_41608701  people_17834515  can make_21740387  their arms_15494473  meet_21194412  round the thumb_15497901 ", wrote_2983252  Pliny_111076501 . 
Although we do not_324548  know_2587430  the true_42543276  shape_15005009  and appearance_14618853  of the  Colossus_3042144 , modern_41590811  reconstructions_1265488  with the statue_14255435  standing_21533085  upright_41281229  are_22579744  more_3100048  accurate_423723  than older_41791508  drawings_13200798 . 
Although it disappeared_2422658  from existence_113768200 , the ancient_41704353  World_19138104  Wonder_17189655  inspired_21631916  modern_41590811  artists_19667719  such as French_43042600  sculptor_110407637  Auguste_Bartholdi_110675021  best_known_41426311  by his famous_41426596  work_14544654 : 
Is_22579744  it simply_34711  a temple_14355393 ?, how could it take_22370954  its place_15542326  among other_42140352  unique_4531147  structures_14290445  such as the Pyramid_13983893 , the Hanging_21469198  Gardens_13380826  and the 
Colossus_of_Rhodes_13042144 ? 
For the people_17834515  who actually_3150716  visited_22468944  it, the answer_16655336  was_22579744  simple_4787983 ; it was_22579744  not_324548  just_34711  a temple_14355393 .
 It was_22579744  the most_3112597  beautiful_4238420  structure_14290445  on earth_19138104 .
It was built_21639788  in honor_114245161  of the Greek_43098588  goddess_19398864  of hunting_1447612 , wild_42470576  nature_19232329  and fertility_15086755 . 
The ancient_41704353  city_18406385  of Ephesus_18664374  near the modern_41590811  town_18544709  of Selcuk, about_37040  50_42267528  km_113479608  south_41660681  of Izmir_18913194  (Smyrna_18913194 ) in Turkey_18910346 . 
Although the foundation_13351237  of the temple_14355393  dates_back_22699624  to the seventh_42279149  century_115006433  BC_32142 , the structure_14290445  that earned_22268651  a spot_18543623  in the list_16395353  of Wonders_17189655  was built_21639788  around_37040  550  BC_32142 . 
Referred_21014090  to as the great_41439123  marble_114751070  temple_14355393 , or temple_14355393  D, it was sponsored_22199365  by the  Lydian  king_110078740  Croesus_110753969  and was designed_21625856  by the Greek_43098588  architect_19661019  Chersiphron. 
The Temple_14355393  was decorated_458628  with bronze_114523408  statues_14255435  sculpted_21669213  by the most_3112597  skilled_42301458  artists_19667719  of their time_114923492 , Pheidias_111068877 , Polycleitus, Kresilas and Phradmon. 
The temple_14355393  served_22645182  as both a marketplace_13681076  and a religious_42126735  institution_13535420 .
 For years_115043767 , the sanctuary_14087005  was visited_22463694  by merchants_110156155 , tourists_110557758 , artisans_19826740  and kings_110078740  who paid_22464177  homage_11213810  to the goddess_19398864  by sharing_22273635  their profits_113087849  with her. 
Recent_41701904  archeological_42725148  excavations_1928298  at the site_18530506  revealed_22123434  gifts_113094498  from pilgrims_110276789  including_22607558  statuettes_13301176  of Artemis_19420080  made_21639033  of gold_114444880  and ivory_114563222   earrings_13228234 , bracelets_12860067  and necklaces_13772301 ... artifacts_120846  from as_322606  far_4465890  as Persia_18785145  and India_18772979 . 
On the night_114967986  of 21_42264727  July_115012957  356  BC_32142 , a man_110133569  named_42511627  Herostratus burned_2374506  the temple_14355393  
to ground in an attempt_1774657  to immortalize_2547761  his name_16248892 , which he did_21697549  indeed_338511 . 
The historian_110025385  Plutarch_111077073  later_361510  wrote_2983252  that the goddess_19398864  was_22579744  "too_347638  busy_4315003  taking_care_22525309  of the birth_17220104  of Alexander_110650831  to send_21933417  help_15093857  to her threatened_22671089  temple_14355393 ". 
And when Alexander_the_Great_110650831  conquered_2457163  Asia_Minor_18580170 , he offered_22275070  to rebuild_21640918  the destroyed_4771690  temple_14355393 , but the Temple_14355393  was not_324548  restored_2257338  until after his death_17254694  in 323  BC_32142 .  
The temple_14355393  was eventually_348463  restored_2257338  and is labeled_21019537  "Temple_14355393  E_16739707 " by archeologists_19660350 .
When St_Paul_111062594  visited_22468944  Ephesus_18664374  to preach_2818899  Christianity_16144185  in the first_42278253  century_115006433  AD_31837 , he was confronted_21068077  by the Artemis_19420080 ' cult_18040756  who had_22182934  no_42345165  plans_15823699  to abandon_22207028  their goddess_19398864 . 
And when the temple_14355393  was again_341086  destroyed_21550911  by the Goths_19988901  in AD_31837  262 , the Ephesians_19912014  vowed_2877452  to rebuild_21640918 . 
By the fourth_42278631  century_115006433  AD_31837 , most_41613064  Ephesians_19912014  had converted_2380397  to Christianity_16144185  and the temple_14355393  lost_22266244  its religious_42126735  glamour_14629801 .
 The final_41050426  chapter_115053414  came_2337964  when in AD_31837  401  the Temple_of_Artemis_14356132  was torn_down_21646820  by St_John_Chrysostom_110923948 . 
Ephesus_18664374  was later_361510  deserted_22559338  and only_311036  in the late_4854652  nineteenth_42280588  century_115006433  has the site_18530506  been excavated_22123750 . 
The digging_1928298  revealed_22123434  the temple_14355393  foundation_13351237  and the road_14050230  to the now_348812  swampy_42631706  site_18530506 . 
Attempts_1774657  were recently_3108293  made_22536272  to rebuild_21640918  the temple_14355393 , but only_34711  a few_41608701  columns_13043105  have been  reerected . 
The foundation_13351237  of the temple_14355393  was_22579744  rectangular_42119550  in form_15005009 , similar_42142615  to most_41613064  temples_14355393  at the time_114923492 . 
Unlike_41461974  other_42140352  sanctuaries_14087005 , however_328097 , the building_12884748  was made_21639033  of marble_114751070 , with a decorated_458628  facade_13278288  overlooking_22670097  a spacious_4500779  courtyard_13088205 . 
Marble_114751070  steps_14246934  surrounding_4472974  the building_12884748  platform_13917097  led_22660685  to the high_41250892  terrace_13855936  which was_22579744  approximately_37040  80_42270411  m_113479010  (260  ft_113470146 ) by 130_42273151  m_113479010  (430  ft_113470146 ) in plan_13909374 . 
The columns_13043105  were_22579744  20_42264613  m_113479010  (60_42268462  ft_113470146 ) high_41250892  with Ionic_42836467  capitals_12927879  and carved_4339965  circular_42111378  sides_18528604 . 
There were_22579744  127  columns_13043105  in total_14302138 , aligned_2459392   orthogonally  over the whole_4541319  platform_13917097  area_12710247 , except for the central_43023930  cella or house_13505558  of the goddess_19398864 . 
The temple_14355393  housed_22675781  many_41607490  works_of_art_14546765 , including_22607558  four_42263051  ancient_41704353  bronze_114523408  statues_14255435  of Amazons_19643532  sculpted_21669213  by the finest_42152179  artists_19667719  at the time_114923492 . 
When St_Paul_111062594  visited_22468944  the city_18406385 , the temple_14355393  was adorned_21660856  with golden_41583826  pillars_13043105  and silver_114461017  statuettes_13301176  and was decorated_458628  with paintings_13833092 . 
There is_22579744  no_42345165  evidence_15751132  that a statue_14255435  of the goddess_19398864  herself was placed_21481373  at the center_18405214  of the sanctuary_14087005 , but there is_22579744  no_42345165  reason_19047424  not_324548  to believe_2675183  so_338511 . 
The early_41791326  detailed_4332927  descriptions_16634244  of the temple_14355393  helped_22523332  archeologists_19660350  reconstruct_21640918  the building_12884748 . 
Many_41607490  reconstructions_1265488  such as that by H.F. von Erlach depicted_21671832  the facade_13278288  with a four_42263051 column_13043105  porch_13939443  which never_321234  existed_22578719 .

However_328097 , its true_42543276  beauty_14628402  lies_22707064  in the architectural_42982619  and artistic_42474419  details_17039683  which will forever_388220  remain_2115825  unknown_41427641 .
