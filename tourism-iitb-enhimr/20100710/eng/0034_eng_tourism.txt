Construction_1897937  of the Dam_13128141  began_22584097  in 1960  as a national_41927794  project_15835584  undertaken_21636528  by Egyptian_43054818  president_110310541  Nasser_111037769  who nationalized_2407217  the Suez_Canal_18772821  to provide_22304993  funds_113186788  for the project_15835584  
With the American and the British refusing_2788896  to secure_2881284  a loan_113226412  for the construction_1897937  it was the Soviets_17943783  that designed_21625020  the earth_114647495  structure_14290445  and provided_21171470  the equipment_13259073  required_22602586  to build_21639788  the power_station_13951635  
During the course_18262401  of construction_1897937  provisions_15723407  were made_21740387  to repatriate_22478285  the Nubian_110209441  inhabitants_19483508  and, in a multinational_41627149  effort_1774657  to relocate_2410079  the Great_41327056  Temple_14355393  of Abu Simbel. 
In 1970 , the Aswan_High_Dam_12725782  was_22725216  inaugurated_22401742  by president_110310541  Sadat_111113956 . 
Today_115062473  the reservoir_14032898  known_as_42511488  Lake_Nasser_19198208  spans_22659604  approximately 500_42274891  kilometers_113479608  across the EgyptioSudanese_43200021  border_18394839  
In spite of the ecological_42991492  problems_114219078  caused_21630835  by the dam_13128141  it has been a blessing_114281580  to the Egyptian_43054818  community_18110535

The idea_15761049  of a canal_12918793  linking the Mediterranean_19215694  to the Red_Sea_19271663  dates_back_22699624  to ancient_41704353  times_114921746

 Over_3228041  the years_115004692  it fell_2145401  again_341086  into disrepair_114367780  and was completely_38032  abandoned_22207318  upon the discovery_141548  of the trade_11077502  route_14050230  around Africa_19057648  
It was Napoleon_111037233  engineers_19479363  who around 1800  AD_31837 , revived_2166088  the idea_15761049  of a shorter_41488508  trade_route_18559241  to India_18772979  via a Suez_Canal_18772821  
However_328097  the calculation_15725136  carried_out_21626161  by the French_43042600  engineers_19479363  showed_21005161  a difference_14692996  in level_15071575  of 10_42263664  meters_113479010  between both_42344813  seas_19291365  
If constructed_21639788  under such_41610028  circumstances_114320169  a large_41434452  land_area_15068532  would be flooded_2447291  
Later_3156731  the calculations_15725136  showed_2656725  to be wrong_4664361  and the final_41637032  attempt_1774657  to dig_21299489  the Canal was undertaken_21636528  by former_41791747  French_43042600  Consul_19812163  in Cairo_18771094  and famous_41426596  Canal_12918793  digger_19864298  Ferdinand_de_Lesseps_110966258 . 
He was granted_22295111  a "firman" or decree_16453059  by the khedive_110077441 . Khedive_110077441  Said of Egypt_18769547  to run_22420190  the Canal for 99_42272272  years_115004692  after completion_1207532  
In 1859 , Egyptian_43054818  workers_110324803  started_2341793  working_22389840  on the construction_1897937  of the Canal in conditions_113735349  described_2955323  by historians_110025385  as slave_110449938  labor_1615043  and the project_15835584  was completed_2479055  around 1867 . 
On November_115014196  17_42264327 , 1869 , the Canal_12918793  was officially_3187836  inaugurated_22401742  by Khedive_110077441  Ismail in an extravagant_42503207  and lavish_42096670  ceremony_17349012  
French_21287560  British_43104384  Russian_43041301  and other_42140352  Royalty_18042221  were invited_21053137  for the inauguration_1236076  which coincided_22635124  with the replanning of Cairo_18771094  
A highway_13481828  was constructed_21639788  linking Cairo_18771094  to the new_41700277  city of Ismailia, an Opera_House_13806937  was built_21639788  and Verdi_111198475  was commissioned_22451382  to compose_21683134  his famous_41426596  opera_16930123  "Aida" for the opening_41049138  ceremony_17349012  
Ironically_3384803  Verdi_111198475  did not complete_2479055  the work_14544654  in time_114923492  and "Aida" premiered_21702968  at the Cairo_18771094  Opera_16930123  a year_115004692  later_3156731  
The Suez_Canal_18772821  emerged_2422281  on the political_41878927  scene_113751057  in 1956 , during the Suez_18772648  crisis_113747542  
It was in July_115012957  of that year_115004692  the Egyptian_43054818  president_110310541  Nasser_111037769 , at age_114946104  38_42266376 , announced_2956159  the nationalization_11136741  of the Canal_12918793  at Mansheya Square_18499347  in Alexandria_18770669  in front of a cheering_4387027  crowd_18069519  
His decision_1159452  was in response_16542601  to the British_43104384  French_43042600  and American_43011995  refusal_17106901  for a loan_113226412  aimed_21016875  at building_22419765  the Aswan_High_Dam_12725782 . 
The revenue_113091403  from the Canal, he argued_2763541 , would help_22531120  finance_22196691  the High_Dam_12725782  project_15835584 . 
The announcement_16655911  triggered_21628963  a swift_41017892  reaction_111252539  by Great_Britain_18733354  France_18802093  and Israel_18668570  who all invaded_21115596  Egypt_18769547  less_41612857  than two_42262856  months_115007086  later_361510  
Their action_11167088  would be condemned_2855139  by the International_41626358  community_18111098  and Nasser_111037769  would eventually_348463  claim_2749848  victory_17371509 . 
In 1967 , the Canal_12918793  was closed_21465564  at the wake_111247049  of the SixDay_War_11286553  when Israel_18668570  occupied_21115596  the Sinai_Peninsula_18769134  causing_2761805  the Canal_12918793  to act_21085009  as a buffer zone_18423287  between the fighting_41721418  forces_18085358  
The Egyptians_19560631  reclaimed_22254778  the Canal_12918793  upon the 1973  ArabIsraeli_War_11286553  and the reopening ceremony_11013155  took_place_2336141  in 1975 .

On 27_42265304  August_115013245  1883 , the Indonesian_43055417  island_19182497  of Rakata almost_373379  vanished__2423097

Krakatau_19044370  (Krakatoa_19044370 ) volcano_19334656  was located on the island_19182497  of Rakata, 40_42266574_km_113479608  off the west coast of Java 
Since early_3101388  historic_41791988  ages_115054535  violent_42594668  volcanic_42911521  activity_113345154  has been known_2587146  to exist_22578719  in the region_18510527  
The "great_41738946  eruption_17334864 " of Krakatau_19044370  must have taken_place_2336141  around 416  AD_31837 , as reported_2957592  in ancient_41704353  Javanese_43156787  scriptures_16344563  
The eruption_17334864  formed_22424524  three_42262966  Islands_19182497  (Rakata, Panjang, and Sertung), and caused_21630835  a 7_42263356  km_113479608  long_41486034  caldera_19098757  (cavity_19258326 ) to form_22598593  underneath Rakata. 
When Krakatau_19044370  erupted_2303830  again_341086  in 1883 , the island_19182497  virtually_373379  collapsed_21970728  into its cavity_19258326  300_42274669  m_113479010  below_380469  sea_level_15072013  
So violent_42594668  was the eruption_17334864  that volcanic_42911521  ash_114574867  and debris_114662237  reached_22659879  as far_4465890  west_4862456  as Madagascar_18833817
