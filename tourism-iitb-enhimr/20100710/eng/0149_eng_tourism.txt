The most_3112597   exploitable  wealth_113079903  that the Portuguese_19586633  found_22134693  was a wood_114900228  that produced_21737120  red_4403623  and purple_4402874  dyes_114788374 , paubrasil (from which the country_18426193  derived_2248424  its name_16248892 ).
Organized_41729305  occupation_1576963  only_310939  began_22583241  in 1530 , when Portugal_18856118  sent_out_21424763  the first_41050981  colonists_110424429  with domestic_animals_11301492 , plants_116858 , and seeds_112966010  to establish_22403508  permanent_41817200  settlements_18113205 .

As a first_41050981  step_1170956  to establish_22403508  the administration_18052497  system_15591863 , the Portuguese_43043215  Crown_16791707  created_21738395  a number_15061203  of hereditary_41362176  fiefs_113079432 , or captaincies_1584344 .
Fourteen_42264049  captaincies_1584344  some larger_41436086  than Portugal_18856118  itself were_22579744  established_22403508  in the mid_4854495  16 th_42280265  century_115006433 , and the beneficiaries_19704746 , called_21018451  donatários, were_22579744  responsible_4347714  for their defense_1940407  and development_1246507 .
The moist_42632460  and fertile_41123029  seaboard_19293199  of what is_22579744  now_348812  the State_18533584  of Pernambuco_18730538  was_22579744  very_332750  suitable_41061348  for growing_21724513   sugar  and also_347757  conveniently_3198938  located_42203379  as a port_of_call_18518940  for sailing_ships_14082391  traveling_21818343  from Portugal_18856118  to West_Africa_19046751  and the Orient_18443031 .
A flourishing_42410551  triangular_4260944  trade_11077502  soon_334685  developed_22598950 , based_43226171  on the importation_13525532  of slave_41107306  labor_18067753  from West_Africa_19046751  to work_22387197  on  sugar  plantations_113082018 .
Paradoxically_323738 , Portugal_18856118  60_42268462  years_115004692  of union_18190959  with Spain_18894294  were_22579744  to confer_22242157  unexpected_4969043  advantages_15082183  on her transatlantic_43030916  colony_18382309 .
In the absence_113774957  of boundaries_113717933 , both_42344813  the Portuguese_19586633  and the Brazilians_19555497  started_22583241  penetrating_21974706  deeper_3307643  into the vast_41439559  hinterlands_18384952 .
Expeditions_1306060  (known_as_42511488  Bandeiras) in search_1931543  of Indian_43012477  slaves_110449938  cut_21897810  their way_1309104  through forest_19151000 , climbed_21904044  the difficult_4782675  escarpments_19141336 , and marched_21901471  across the inland_4488131  plateau_19317411 .
In 1640 , when the Portuguese_19586633  under John VI recovered_22226903  their Independence_113808065 , they refused_2788896  to abandon_22207028  the lands_18437765  they had occupied_21115596  and colonized_22565761  west_3326112  of the original_13686056  Tordesillas line_18473264 .

The second_41056378  half_113556027  of the 17 th_42280371  century_115006433  saw_22090675  Portugal_18856118  freed_41107001  from Spanish_43042784  rule_114251219 , the northeast_41659943  of Brazil_18727882  liberated_22397810  from a 24_42265016 year_115004692  occupation_11117760  by Dutch_43044695  forces_18085358 , and the weakening_17326085  of Brazil_18727882  sugar_17752883  economy_18252295 .
While the gold_rush_11108388  which followed_22696027  drained_21146858  
thousands_113569755  of people_18067057  away_3234576  from the coastal_4487256  plantations_113082018 , it also_347757  attracted_21492358  fresh_41701075  immigration_18299619  from Portugal_18856118 .
Altogether_363957  nearly_373379  1 ,000  tons_113540841  of gold_114444880  and 3_42262966  million_113570444  carats_113543031  of diamonds_114639066  were taken_2170552  from the region_18509674  between_3501357  1700  and l800 .
The growth_113323403  of gold_114444880  mining_1909126  in Brazil_18727882  was_22579744  an important_41323836  development_114231209  which influenced_22512310  the course_19252587  of events_128105  not_only_325615  in the colony_18382309  but also in Europe_19142657 .
But the boom_17375532  in gold_114444880  and diamond_114639066  mining_1909126 , like that of sugar_17752883 , was_22579744  destined_4363282  to be followed_22696027  by the rise_17224691  of an even_317682  more_3100048  important_41323836  source_19975469  of wealth_114298466 , coffee_17821980 .
Just_3159561  as mining_1909126  caused_21630835  a migration_11108179  of people_17834515  from Pernambuco_18730538  and Bahia southwards_3465650  to Minas Gerais, so the spread_1364065  of coffee_112494568  growing_21724513  advanced_22530608  the settlement_11236412  of empty_41128234  land_18437765  still_317682  further_330352  to the south_3245339 .

Another_42141203  important_41323836  event_128105  in the second_42278352  half_113556027  of the 18 th_42280479  century_115006433  was_22579744  the transfer_1312417  of the seat_18527185  of colonial_42786249  government_17941270 .
After more_than_41611077  200_42274562  years_115004692  in Salvador, the capital_18400383  was moved_21818343  to Rio_de_Janeiro_18730329 , where it dominated_22621680  the main_41325646  access_12646786  route_18496118  to Minas Gerais and was_22579744  closer_3410091  to the growing_42619276  population_18066746  centers_18396101  in the southern_41661530  regions_18509674  of the colony_18382309 .
Monopolizing_22418887  all_42345966  trade_11077502  with Brazil_18727882 , Portugal_18856118  retained_22261779  a substantial_4656834  part_113628130  of the profits_113087849 , and this led_2762984  to growing_42619276  discontent_17436521  among the settlers_110424429 .
