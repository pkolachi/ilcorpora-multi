The bridge_12870570  was_22579744  more_than_41611077  just_34711  a river_19276541  crossing_19150608  though_3120271 .
It had_22182934  its own_41831352  chapel_12977524  and many_41607490  shops_14153847  and houses_13505558  too_347757 .
The third_42278495  one was designed_21625856  by John Rennie and built_21639788  in 1832  by his son_110464570 , after his death_17254694 .
It was painstakingly_3418844  dismantled_21646820  and then_3118752  reconstructed_21640918  in the Arizona_18927322  Desert_18387780  where it still_332017  stands_22710162  and carries_21206764  six_42263219  lanes_13599894  of traffic_18310925 .
 William McGonagall (1825 1902 ) found_22134693  the bridge_12870570  extremely_390086  busy_438287  when he visited_21826333  London_18746271  and wrote_21683134  his awful_41171307  poem_16291864  'Jottings of London'.
The bridge_12870570  also_347757  inspired_21631916  the famous_41426596  nursery_rhyme_17123832  'London Bridge is falling down'!  
The current_4699223  rather_318345  dull_4416251  looking_41941328  bridge_12870570  was completed_2479055  in 1972 .
In the 2 nd_42278352  century_115006433 , London_18746271  (then_3119035  called_42511627  Londinium) was controlled_22417363  by the Roman_43006303  invaders_110061553  and a wall_14492403  was built_21639788  to protect_21117411  it.
 Today_348812  sections_14117433  of this city_18406385  wall_14006297  are_22579744  still_332017  visible_42599165 , mingling_21449281  among the office_13798928  blocks_18521606 .
Cross_sections_18429393  of parts_13849293  of the wall_14492403  show_22129054  where medieval_43072481  Londoners_19564691  continued_22723234  to maintain_22258588  and add_2179714  to the wall_14492403 .
 Areas_18379933  of London_18746271  still_332017  bear_247200  the names_16248892  of the gates_13390689  in the wall_14492403 , the main_41325646  ones being_22579744  Aldgate, Cripplegate, Bishopsgate, Newgate and Ludgate.
 Large_41434452  sections_14117433  of the wall_14492403  can be seen_22109658  close_3411998  to the Museum_13758208  of London_18746271  and near Tower Hill station_14254650  next to the Tower_of_London_14407859 .

 The Mall as we see_22109658  it today_348812  was designed_41860397  at the beginning_17190972  of this century_115006433  by the architect_19661019  Aston Webb, who also_347757  designed_41860397  the Victoria Monument_13702493  and rebuilt_21640918  the front_13362210  of the Buckingham_Palace_18748472  around the same_42139473  time_114923492 .

Look_22110736  out for the drinking_fountain_13207589  set_42203379  in the church_12998121  wall_14492403 ; it was_22579744  the first_41050981  metropolitan_42950292  public_41927223  drinking_fountain_13207589  and was originally_3434462  erected_21646259  on Holborn Hill_19169290  in 1859 .
It was moved_21818343  to its present_41793279  position_18501323  in 1867  when the Holborn viaduct_14478171  was built_21639788 .

Originally_3434462  John Nash built_21639788  it as a gateway_13391870  for

So it was moved_21818343  to its present_41793279  site_18530506  and now_349572  stands_22710162  surrounded_21454632  by a chaotic_41730719  mass_113593557  of traffic_18310925 .
