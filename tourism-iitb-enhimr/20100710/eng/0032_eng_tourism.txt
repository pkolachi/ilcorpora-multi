The first_half_115057991  of the nineteenth_42280588  century_115006433  was marked_2643995  by the Industrial_Revolution_115059829  in Europe_19142657 , in which the expanding_2306614  science_15923754  of metallurgy_16045650  played_22347932  a primary_41325646  role_1709615 .
Cast_iron_114607206  made_22333219  its debut_1234206  in the construction_11089921  industry_17955545  in 1779  with the bridge_12870570  at Coalbrookdale in England_18743642 , followed_22696217  in 1803  by the Pont des Arts bridge_12870570  in Paris_18804587 .
Metal_41582534  structures_14290445  soon_334685  began_22583241  to 
 find their way  into textile_13274763  factories_13281361 , into stage_14245325  construction_1897937  and glasshouses_13421120 .
By around_37040  1845  laminated_21379331  iron_114448480  was taking_over_22252938  as a more_3100048  efficient_4536074  and economic_4878893  material_114387488  than cast_iron_114607206 , heralding_2964464  a spectacular_4611005  rejuvenation_111339358  in the conception_15762938  of buildings_12884748 .
The central_4989967  market_13424195  building_12884748  in Paris_18804587 , Les Halles, was erected_21646259  in 1853  by Victor Baltard and Felix Callet.
It was_22579744  the first_41050981  building_12884748  in France_18802093  to openly_353782  display_22120184  its metalwork_13711076 .
The use_1933270  of iron_114448480  in architecture_12709284  spread_2960182  widely_3498494 , and became_2147020  one of the most_3112597  original_41747932  and spectacular_41332414  forms_15766180  of creative_4615384  expression_16973028  of the nineteenth_42280588  century_115006433 , because of its lightness_14969685 , its transparency_14646647  and the elegant_4888119  way_14873611  it rises_22670770  into the air_114645770 , coupled with its brute_41311326  strength_14970691 , its restrained_42483380  power_14971665  and its extreme_41589960  tautness_114351635 .
By the year_115004692  1885 , the time_17209466  when the Tower_14407080  was being constructed_21639788 , the use_1933270  of iron_114448480  and steel_114607735  in bridges_12870570  and building_12884748  frameworks_14878053  had become_2147020  widespread_41145472 .
The engineer_19479363 , and his expertise_15571100  in calculation_15725136  and construction_1897937 , came_2536727  to have_22182934  an increasingly_360161  important_41323836  role_1709615  in architecture_16043371 .
The bridge_12870570  over the Firth_19147526  of Forth_19151435  in Scotland_18762614 , opened_22402576  in 1889 , achieved_22501902  a record_161122  span_15027908  of 521  meters_113479010 .
There was_22579744  even_317682  talk_17041192  of a bridge_12870570  with a span_15027908  wide_42644847  enough_42415123  to cross_21894239  the English_Channel_19140631 .
In Chicago_18952889  in the United_States_18915715 , steel_114607735  started_22583241  to be employed_21147708  to erect_21646259  buildings_12884748  of enormous_41437585  height_15076538 .
An engineer_19479363  by training_1881267 , Eiffel_110792055  founded_22403508  and developed_21723473  a company_17948427  specializing_2432956  in metal_114431555  structural_42981838  work_1570312 , whose crowning_41636587  achievement_133580  was_22579744  the Eiffel_Tower_13232528 .
He devoted_2878156  the last_41792257  thirty_42265602  years_115004692  of his life_113775382  to his experimental_4899080  research_1630686 .
Born_41795551  in Dijon_18807652  in 1832 , he graduated_22243208  from the Ecole Centrale des Arts et Manufactures in 1855 , the same_42139473  year_115004692  that Paris_18804587  hosted_21183195  the first_41050981  World_19138104  Fair_18294214 .
He spent_22683126  several_42344948  years_115004692  in the south_west_113651916  of France_18802093 , where he supervised_22419390  work_1570312  on the great_41439123  railway_14002766  bridge_12870570  in Bordeaux_18806513 , and afterwards_361510  he set_up_21646488  in his own_41831352  right_3206517  in 1864  as a "constructor_19732731 ", that is, as a business_17951353  specializing_2432956  in metal_114431555  structural_42981838  work_1570312 .
His outstanding_42422969  career_1278838  as a constructor_19732731  was marked_22098934  by work_1570312  on the Porto_18857697  viaduct_14478171  over the river_19276541  Douro in 1876 , the Garabit viaduct_14478171  in 1884 , Pest railway_station_14003789  in Hungary_18823846 , the dome_13187284  of the Nice_18809048  observatory_13796933 , and the ingenious_4675979  structure_14290445  of the Statue_of_Liberty_14255694 .
It culminated_2480498  in 1889  with the Eiffel_Tower_13232528 .
After the end_115066306  of his career_1577821  in business_11080062 , marred_2472923  by the failure_164687  of the Panama_Canal_13837552 , Eiffel_110792055  began_2341793  an active_434012  life_113777175  of scientific_42878700  experimental_4898902  research_1630686  in the fields_15920396  of meteorology_16038575 , radiotelegraphy_16192946  and aerodynamics_16034458 .
Eiffel_110792055  built_21639788  hundreds_113569316  of metal_114431555  structures_14290445  of all_42345966  kinds_15766180  all_38032  around the world_19138104 .
Bridges_12870570 , and in_particular_3250201  railway_14002766  bridges_12870570 , were_22579744  his favorite_41515196  field_11082437  of work_1578942 , but he also_347757  won_22266750  renown_114245690  for his metal_114431555  structural_42981838  work_1570312  and industrial_42833942  installations_1237152 .
His career_1278838  was marked_22098934  by a large_41434452  number_15061203  of fine_4888945  buildings_12884748 , among which two of the most_3112597  outstanding_42422969  are_22579744  the twin_41540223  edifices_12884748  of the Porto_18857697  viaduct_14478171  and the Garabit viaduct_14478171  in the Cantal region_18509674  of France_18802093 .
Equally_322606  outstanding_42422969  are_22579744  certain_4737316  other_42140352  structures_14290445  in which the pure_41974444  inventiveness_15564063  of Eiffel_110792055  company_17948427  was allowed_2793809  free_rein_113807759 , such as the "portable_41580908 " bridges_12870570  sold_22221378  around the world_19138104  in "kits_13579633 ", the ingenious_4675979  structure_14290445  of the Statue_of_Liberty_14255694  in New_York_18988202 , and of_course_339495  the Eiffel_Tower_13232528  itself.
In 1887  Eiffel_110792055  agreed_2755674  to build_21639788  the locks_13642255  of the Panama_canal_13837552 , an immense_41439559  undertaking_1784188  badly_311541  managed_22412701  by Ferdinand_De_Lesseps_110966258 , which ended_22584658  in the biggest_41434452  financial_42933054  scandal_17206158  of the century_115006433 .
This was_22579744  the biggest_41434452  contract_16434335  in his entire_4541797  career_1278838  in business_17951353 , and also_347757  the one with the greatest_41738946  risk_1790706 .
Given_430187  the risk_114349152  he faced_2803613 , he was granted_22234159  major_41525017  financial_42933054  advantages_15082183  and solid_41170022  guarantees_113181243 , which allowed_22399666  him to collect_22283208  his profit_113087849  as soon as the work_1570312  was begun_2341793 .
Despite the care_15546338  which Eiffel_110792055  took_22089527  in the project_1784188 , the liquidation_1224735  of the canal_12918793  construction_1897937  company_17948427 , Compagnie du Canal, on February_115011276  4_42263051  1889 , led_2762984  to his own_41831352  indictment_17136372  for fraud_1757533  alongside De Lesseps and his son_110464570 , and to a sentence_115025504  of two_42262856  years_115004692  in prison_13960475  and a fine_113130150  of 2000  francs_113481978 , even though nothing_113559365  could really_338096  be blamed_2833586  on him personally_3132861 .
With his honor_14813782  and dignity_14831727  severely_315978  compromised_21026104 , he withdrew_2790841  from business_17951353 .
The ruling_11175952  was later_3156731  to be annulled_22454180  by the highest_42418366  appeal_11170405  court_18214856 , the Cour de Cassation, liberating_22397810  him of all_42345966  obligations_16682375  concerning_22650259  the accusations_17135285 , which 
put an end to any_324980  further_331156  court_18214856  action_11166678  against him.
In retirement_113768065  following_22696027  the Panama_18616640  scandal_17206158 , Eiffel_110792055  devoted_2878156  the final_41050426  thirty_42265602  years_115004692  of his life_113775382  to a fruitful_41932493  career_1577821  as a scientist_110402286 .
First_of_all_3103443  he set_2401967  himself to finding_22134693  a practical_41899798  application_1935248  for the Tower_14407080 , which had only_34711  been built_21639788  to stand_21533085  for twenty_42264613  years_115004692 .
He collected_22283208  meteorological_42950599  data_18347159  at posts_13943294  installed_21556333  in his various_4519472  properties_113073742 , and at_the_same_time_3121228  pursued_22352377  his research_1630686  into aerodynamics_16034458 , building_1897937  a wind_tunnel_14536653  right_3206517  at the foot_18393691  of the Tower_14407080 , and then_3118752  a second_113663361  and much_359568  larger_41434452  one on Rue_14072008  Bouding, a television_14352389  mast_13685775  whose peak_18556805  is_22579744  at a height_15076538  of 324  meters_113479010 .
The first_41050981  television_16194755  trials_1779545  to use_21147708  the Tower_14407080  date_back_22699624  to 1921 , and the first_41050981  regular_42447431  broadcasts_16172112  started_22583241  in 1935 .
In 1889  the tower_14407080  was a colossal_41437060  fairground_18494457  attraction_16527708 , but during the 1920 s it became_2147020  a symbol_15694678  of modernity_14991814  and the avantgarde_18350397 , inspiring_21631916  poets_110288082  such as Guillaume_Apollinaire_110658923 , filmmakers_19938339 , photographers_110271186  and numerous_41608276  painters_110236454 .
Its effect_111246064  was_22579744  a burst_1549942  of almost_373379  ethereal_4742877  clarity_14645962 , of the kind_15766180  only_38625  metal_114431555  creates_21738395 , piercing_21429870  the architectural_42982619  landscape_18526142  of Paris_18804587 .
Its honesty_14816050  and plainness_14766211  of appearance_14618853  intensified_2286822  the artistic_43073831  debate_17042854  that had been opened_22401867  thirty_42265602  years_115004692  earlier_361246 , giving_22294885  form_15766180  to the division_17083300  between architects_19661019  and engineers_19479363 , between arts_16072885  and science_15923754 , and embodying_22716000  a new_4146783  type_15767228  of expression_16787859  through structure_14290445  and space_113725184 .
Its abstract_412333  qualities_14668449 , without practical_41899798  purpose_15905960  in themselves, and the purity_114294075  of its design_15658320 , made_2118050  it a subject_16511803  for the many_41607490  forms_15855685  of artistic_43073831  expression_16787859  of the city_18406385  and the country_18426193  which had created_21738395  it.
The Tower_14407080  very_332750  soon_334685  became_2147020  a favorite_41880858  subject_14295930  for painters_110236454 , and contemporary_41591214  artists_19667719  continue_22659138  to use_21147708  it as their model_110170356 .
Georges_Seurat_111130258  painted_21669775  it in 1888 , even_317682  before_361246  its completion_1207532 .
The pointilist_41852150  style_15771096  of the picture_13886823 , with colored_4416821  marks_16707600  juxtaposed_21489064  to draw_21675192  light_14895530  and movement_111260418  out of the shapes_126552 , is_22579744  exactly_3159561  consistent_4606880  with the Tower_14407080  own_41831352  style_15771096  of architectural_42982619  expression_16787859 .
Later_361510  the Tower_14407080  was also_347757  celebrated_22375631  by Le_Douanier_Rousseau_111109028 , Signac, Bonnard, Utrillo_111193680 , Gromaire, Vuillard_111205006 , Dufy_110782489  and Chagall_110727927 .
Robert Delaunay gave_22294885  it cubist_43103401  facets_15777344  in a whole_4541319  series_18342833  of canvases_12925700  started_22583241  in 1910 .
Eiffel_110792055  had not_324548  foreseen_2712514  that this materialization_113338242  of an artistic_43073831  vision_15697479  could become_2147020  the world_19138104  famous_41426596  emblem_13248069  of a city_18406385  like Paris_18804587 , unique_4531147  in its exceptional_41737538  size_15038931  but reducible_4922375  and reproducible_41934515  
ad_infinitum_388455 .
Right from the beginning_17190972  the popular_41880320  success_114282210  of the Tower_14407080  manifested_2418775  itself in a multitude_113594148  of varying_42591322  forms_15855685   miniature_41445752  models_13735773 , bottles_12848798  and candles_12919653 , bracelet_12860067  charms_12980027  and watches_14501415 , paper_cutters_13843379  and lamp_13595954  stands_12771089 .
Eiffel_110792055  had thought_2700261  about exploiting_21153149  the image_13886823  of the Tower_14407080  commercially_377898  himself, but faced_2803613  with a general_4512410  outcry_17022785  from hordes_18070102  of goods_13045684  producers_110138618 , he gave_up_22214143  his rights_113170198  and let_22399666  the image_13886823  fall_22705637  into the public_domain_113073301 .
The Tower_14407080  was also_347757  copied_21678744  on a large_scale_41440658 , most_3112597  notably_3140197  at LyonFourviere, Blackpool_18750982 , NewBrighton near Liverpool_18750004 , Tokyo_18795550 , Berlin_18646494  and most_3112597  recently_3108293  at Sttenzhen in China_18600800 .
The plan_15823699  to build_21639788  a tower_14407080  300_42274669  meters_113479010  high_41250892  was conceived_21618863  as part_1775927  of preparations_11128041  for the World_19138104  Fair_18294214  of 1889 .
Emile Nouguier and Maurice Koechlin, the two_42262856  chief_110011822  engineers_19479363  in Eiffel_110792055  company_17948427 , had_22088655  the idea_15761049  for a very_332750  tall_42466583  tower_14407080  in June_115012596  1884 .
It was_22579744  to be designed_21625020  like a large_41434452  pylon_13983349  with four_42263051  columns_113715472  of lattice_work_13606203  girders_13401301 , separated_4569948  at the base_13351237  and coming_together_22036222  at the top_18543040 , and joined_22597114  to each other by more_41612299  metal_114431555  girders_13401301  at regular_42453063  intervals_15030185 .
The company_17948427  had by this time_17209466  mastered_2590054  perfectly_39675  the principle_15799975  of building_1897937  bridge_12870570  supports_14307837 .
The tower_14407080  project_1784188  was_22579744  a bold_4271655  extension_1363857  of this principle_15799975  up to a height_15076538  of 300  meters_113479010   equivalent_41462676  to the symbolic_42892098  figure_15061203  of 1000_42275012  feet_113470146 .
On September_115013529  18_42264422 , 1884 , Eiffel_110792055  registered_22447811  a patent_16414893  "for a new_4146783  configuration_15661155  allowing_22399666  the construction_1897937  of metal_114431555  supports_14307837  and pylons_13983349  capable_4328551  of exceeding_22643904  a height_15076538  of 300_42274669  meters_113479010 ".
The Koechlin's plan_15823699 : In order to make_2118050  the project_1784188  more_3100048  acceptable_418488  to public_opinion_15874000 , Nouguier and Koechlin commissioned_22451382  the architect_19661019  Stephen Sauvestre to work_on_21653620  the project_1784188  appearance_14618853 .
Sauvestre proposed_2866135  stonework_14275629  pedestals_13860001  to dress_21453805  the legs_13614190 , monumental_41441291  arches_12708083  to link_21342435  the columns_13043488  and the first_42278253  level_13330723 , large_41434452  glass_114684725 walled_21119843  halls_13441041  on each_42346315  level_13330723 , a bulb_13625109 shaped_43214540  design_13146300  for the top_18543040  and various_42136680  other_42140352  ornamental_41133218  features_15776742  to decorate_21660856  the whole_15795381  of the structure_14290445 .
In_the_end_348228  the project_1784188  was simplified_2396151 , but certain_4737316  elements_13049932  such as the large_41434452  arches_12708083  at the base_13351237  were retained_22386609 , which in part_37728  give_22294885  it its very_332750  characteristic_4380001  appearance_14618853 .
The curvature_15042406  of the uprights_14461347  is mathematically_365156  determined_2909540  to offer_22275070  the most_3112597  efficient_4536074  wind_111359581  resistance_111337456  possible_41886604 .
As Eiffel_110792055  explains: "All the cutting_4841617  force_14976345  of the wind_111359581  passes_22031827  into the interior_18468332  of the leading_edge_13611103  uprights_14461347 ."
Lines_16708603  drawn_21569358  tangential_42893985  to each_42346315  upright_14461347  with the point_15792029  of each_42346315  tangent_113686934  at the same_42139473  height_15076538 , will always_319576  intersect_22005144  at a second_42278352  point_15792029 , which is_22579744  exactly_3159561  the point_15792029  through which passes_22031827  the flow_17304963  resultant_4141351  from the action_113345154  of the wind_111359581  on that part_13849293  of the tower_14407080  support_14307837  situated_42203379  above the two_42262856  points_15792029  in_question_42044734 .
Before coming_together_22036222  at the high_41250892  pinnacle_13899013 , the uprights_14461347  appear_22113647  to burst_out_2421856  of the ground_19200358 , and in a way_14873611  to be shaped_2139777  by the action_113345154  of the wind_111359581 ".
The assembly_1898890  of the supports_14307837  began_22583241  on July_115012957  1_42262724 , 1887  and was completed_2479055  twentytwo_42264821  months_115007086  later_361510 .
All the elements_13049932  were prepared_2401967  in Eiffel_110792055  factory_13281361  located_42203379  at LevalloisPerret on the outskirts_18420721  of Paris_18804587 .
Each of the 18 ,000  pieces_13888000  used_42578358  to construct_21639788  the Tower_14407080  were specifically_341621  designed_41390775  and calculated_41908597 ,
traced_21679239  out to an accuracy_14747462  of a tenth_113557524  of a millimeter_113478505  and then_3118752  put_together_21641804  forming_22598593  new_42141686  pieces_13888000  around_37040  five_42263136  meters_113479010  each_3241213 .
A team_18095502  of constructors_19732731 , who had worked_on_21653620  the great_41439123  metal_114431555  viaduct_14478171  projects_1784188 , were responsible_4347714  for the 150_42273624  to 300_42274669  workers_19495263  on site_18530506  assembling_21641804  this gigantic_41438796  erector set_17888016 .
All the metal_114431555  pieces_13888000  of the tower_14407080  are held_22655994  together_3117929  by rivets_14049506 , a well_311118 refined_4889410  method_15590135  of construction_1897937  at the time_114923492  the Tower_14407080  was constructed_21639788 .
First_3103443  the pieces_13888000  were assembled_21641804  in the factory_13281361  using_21147708  bolts_12837829 , later_361510  to be replaced_2159902  one_by_one_3157600  with thermally_3128855  assembled_4491880  rivets_14049506 , which contracted_2237511  during cooling_113280336  thus_342866  ensuring_2881284  a very_332750  tight_42169561  fit_14874997 .
A team_18095502  of four_42263051  men_18099269  was needed_22602586  for each_42346315  rivet_14049506  assembled_4491880 : one to heat_2367235  it up, another to hold_21587693  it in_place_3257019 , a third_113663697  to shape_2139777  the head_13463325  and a fourth_113663921  to beat_21610508  it with a sledgehammer_13690445 .
Only a third_113556418  of the 2 ,500 ,000  rivets_14049506  used_42578358  in the construction_1897937  of the Tower_14407080  were inserted_21409390  directly_352235  on site_18530506 .
The uprights_14461347  rest_214425  on concrete_114624767  foundations_13351237  installed_21556333  a few_41608701  meters_113479010  below groundlevel_13426090  on top_18543040  of a layer_13609573  of compacted_21471150  gravel_114505039 .
Each_42346315  corner_13077724  edge_13229888  rests_214425  on its own_41831352  supporting_4237981  block_12824782 , applying_22287391  to it a pressure_111329024  of 3_42262966  to 4_42263051  kilograms_113544036  per  square centimeter , and each_42346315  block_12824782  is joined_21279484  to the others by walls_14492403 .
On the Seine_19294323  side_18528604  of the construction_14290445 , the builders_19732731  used_21147708  watertight_41450764  metal_114431555  caissons_12908742  and injected_21572236  compressed_4541055  air_114645770 , so that they were_22579744  able_41740  to work_22389840  below the level_15071575  of the water_17828101 .
The tower_14407080  was assembled_21641804  using_21147708  wooden_42660823  scaffolding_14095002  and small_41443454  steam_114857311  cranes_13094665  mounted_4179720  onto the tower_14407080  itself.
The assembly_1898890  of the first_42278253  level_13330723  was achieved_22501902  by the use_1933270  of twelve_42263833  temporary_41818388  wooden_42660823  scaffolds_14094713 , 30_42265602  meters_113479010  high_41250892 , and four_42263051  larger_41436086  scaffolds_14094713  of 40_42266574  meters_113479010  each_3241213 .
"Sand_boxes_14087849 " and hydraulic_43154206  jacks_13549370   replaced_2159902  after use_1933270  by permanent_41817200  wedges_14515014   allowed_22399666  the metal_114431555  girders_13401301  to be positioned_21968840  to an accuracy_14747462  of one_42262724  millimeter_113478505 .
On December_115014564  7_42263356 , 1887 , the joining_1142477  of the major_41525017  girders_13401301  up to the first_42278253  level_13330723  was completed_2479055 .
The pieces_13888000  were hauled_21442103  up_397040  by steam_114857311  cranes_13094665 , which themselves climbed_21904044  up the Tower_14407080  as they went_21818343  along_368731  using_21147708  the runners_14074184  to be used_21147708  for the Tower_14407080  lifts_13246623 .
It only_34711  took_22246711  five_42263136  months_115007086  to build_21639788  the foundations_13351237  and twentyone_42264727  to finish_2479055  assembling_11000048  the metal_114431555  pieces_13888000  of the Tower_14407080 .
Considering_2940862  the rudimentary_4551554  means_1169254  available_4203394  at that period_115096136 , this could be considered_2682517  record_161122  speed_14999076 .
The assembly_1898890  of the Tower_14407080  was_22579744  a marvel_17189655  of precision_14748435 , as all_42345966  chroniclers_19774657  of the period_115096136  agree_2796868 .
The construction_1897937  work_1570312  began_2341793  in January_115010835  1887  and was finished_2479055  on March_115011660  31_42265692 , 1889 .
On the narrow_42646187  platform_13917097  at the top_18543040 , Eiffel_110792055  received_22189688  his decoration_16616973  from the  Legion of Honor .
Journalist_110071857  Emile Goudeau describes_2977345  the spectacle_16796766  visiting_22468944  the construction_1897937  site_18530506  at the beginning_17190972  of 1889 .
A thick_4566266  cloud_111274984  of tar_114715051  and coal_114619786  smoke_111341904  seized_21201252  the throat_15478544 , and we were deafened_22170013  by the din_17276524  of metal_114431555  screaming_22153558  beneath the hammer_13443306 .
Over there_3110157  they were still_332017  working_22389840  on the bolts_12837829 : workmen_110630063  with their iron_114448480  bludgeons_12828052 , perched_21530865  on a ledge_19203177  just_3159561  a few_41608701  centimeters_113478676  wide_42644847 , 
took_turns_2118948  at striking_22085259  the bolts_12837829  (these, in_fact_3150075 , were_22579744  the rivets_14049506 ).
One could have taken_2616892  them for blacksmiths_19713526  contentedly_3239512  beating_21610508  out a rhythm_16989205  on an anvil_12700424  in some_42343988  village_18551779  forge_13347903 , except that these smiths_110455241  were not_324548  striking_21398039  up_397040  and down_396027  vertically_3360498 , but horizontally_3360324 , and as with each_42346315  blow_11157814  came_22719569  a shower_17262773  of sparks_17311331 , these black_4415089  figures_13300317 , appearing_22113647  larger_than_life_41438268  against the background_15858450  of the open_41681159  sky_19301235 , looked_22113647  as if they were reaping_21308395  lightning_111309788  bolts_111352914  in the clouds_19114764 .
Installing_1237152  public_41927223  elevators_13246623  on the Tower_14407080  raised_21742566  many_41607490  technical_42894375  questions_17094985 , since there had been_22579744  no_42345165  previous_4145187  experience_15687322  in elevators_13246623  climbing_21904044  to such_41610028  heights_18464685  and with such_41610028  loads_113591619 ; the slanting_41281946  tracks_14410735  with various_42136680  angles_113702873  further_331156  complicated_2398263  the problems_114219078 .
The original_41919217  machines_13659195  in the west_4862456  and east_4861485  piers_13889694  (up to the first_42278253  floor_13330723  only_34711 ) were provided_21171470  by the French_43042600  company_17948427  Roux Combaluzier Lepape, using_21147708  hydraulically_3362183  powered_41893920  double_42293400  looped_42395793  chains_12970247  and rollers_14055626  in side_42523327  guides.
Their poor_41173827  performance_113351731  led_22610448  to their removal_1387602 .
They were replaced_2159902  in 1897  and 1899  by the FivesLille machinery_13660842 , relying_2680280  on hydraulic_43154206  accumulators_14277160 , 16_42264235 meter_113479010  long_41486034  main_41325646  pistons_13904574 , cable_12905835  loops_13018760  and manual_4203184  controls_13065736 .
They were_22579744  a success_17218904 , steadfastly_351204  lifting_21955745  the tourists_110557758  up to the second_42278352  floor_13330723  until the late_4854652  eighties_114952017 .
They were then_3118752  upgraded_2204182  to conform_22637653  to the present_day_4700262  regulations_16575164 : the old_41697790  machinery_13660842  still_332017  provides_21171470  the counterweight_13086546  power_111288081  for the 
dead_weights_14968564 , while the variable_41069473  parts_113628130  of the loads_113591619  were driven_21170502  by modern_41590811  high_41257379  pressure_111329024  oil_pumps_13801812  and motors_13748049  controlled_21213361  by computers_13051890 .
The original_4735657  American_43011995  elevators_13246623  by Otis_111055223  in the north_41658684  and south_41660681  piers_13889694  took_21981555  visitors_110596386  up_397040  to the second_42278352  floor_13330723  in a double_42293400 decker_13136053   cabin_2931966 , using_21147708  hydraulically_3362183  powered_41893920  cables_12905835 .
They were_22579744  no_325058  match_13687557  for the FivesLille units_113629194  and were scrapped_22202531  respectively_3138726  in 1900  from the south_41660681  pillar_13043105  and shortly_334685  after 1912  from the north_41658684  pillar_13043105 , after a failed_22498138  attempt_1774657  to  repower  it with an electric_42912211  motor_13748049 .
