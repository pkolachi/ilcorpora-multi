Medical_42845379  advice_16582579  should be sought_22219395  for any_42344366  
animal_4114955  bite_114096558 , and a tetanus_113997452  injection_114653737  given_22287600 .
Symptoms_114108771  can usually_3107782  be prevented_22428989  from developing_22598950  if proper_41945146  treatment_1650240  is started_2344775  immediately_349076  after being bitten.
Early_4851244  treatment_1650240  is_22579744  especially_384750  important_4688962  following bites on the face_15531141 .
If you have not_324548  been_22579744  vaccinated_42444336  before you were bitten, 
human rabies immunoglobulin (HRIG), also_347757  known_as_42511488  passive immunisation, will be injected_285500  around the bite_114096558  to neutralise_21315499  the virus_11312417  before it gets_into_21998301  the body_15154650 .
This substance_119102  binds_21344512  to the virus_11312417  so that the immune_system_15393243  can destroy_21314784  it.
In_addition_346444 , a longerlasting rabies_114081020  vaccine_14463717  (active immunisation) should be given_22287600  in 5_42263136 6_42263219  doses_13191991  over 30_42265602  days_114956162 .
The vaccine_14463717  is given_22294885  into the arm_15494473  and is_22579744  relatively_3161879  painless_41774861 , with minimal_41549428  side_effects_114120984  that may include_22607558  headaches_114135372 , fever_114174023 , nausea_114168673 , muscle_15225981  aches_114132448 , and dizziness_114181180 .
If you have already_332511  been_22579744  vaccinated_42444336  before being bitten (the  preexposure  vaccine_14463717 ), two_42262856  doses_13191991  of the rabies_114081020  vaccine_14463717  will be given_22287600 : one_42262724  at the time_17209466  of the bite, and one_42262724  3_42262966 7_42263356  days_114956162  later_3156731 .
The body_15154650  should respond_2710443  to treatment_1650240  quickly_3106318 .
If the infected_42190227  person_17626  is_22579744  not_324548  treated_42025005  and symptoms_114108771  have developed_22598950  (see symptoms_114108771 ), rabies_114081020  is said_21005919  to be established.
In this situation_114219716 , nothing can be done_21697549 , except to keep_22655994  them comfortable_4501349 .
They should be nursed_279903  in a darkened_4297405  room_14060022  and their symptoms_114108771  kept_22655994  under_control_3508159  with equipment_13259073  and medication_13698752 .
A very_332750  small_41443454  number_15061203  of patients_110250423  with established_41961572  rabies_114081020  have been successfully_3121072  treated_277958 , using_21147708  heavy_41237334  sedation_1684281  and intensive_care_1700183  facilities_1579981  to maintain_22258588  the action of the heart_15324154  and the 
respiratory_system_15441259 , but those who have survived_22594822  have suffered_264897  
long_term_41493378  disability_114355720 .
In the height_113754402  of the polio_113951824  epidemic_17333958 , the standard_4512737  treatment_1650240  involved_22610758  placing_21481373  a patient_110250423  with paralysis_114365468  of the breathing_4289688  muscles_15226221  in an "iron_lung_13546767 "  a large_41434452  machine_13659195  that actually_3150716  pushed_21854390  and pulled_21595573  the chest_15483589  muscles_15226221  to make_2761805  them work_22501264 .
The damaged_4713387  limbs_15490999  were often_335856  kept_22655994  immobilized_21195865  because of the confinement of the iron_lung_13546767 .
In countries_18426193  where polio_113951824  is_22579744  still_332017  a concern_15759473 , ventilators_12867465  and some_42343988  iron_lungs_13546767  are still_332017  used_21147708 .
Historically_3110693 , home_42828586  treatment_1650240  for paralytic polio and 
abortive polio with neurological symptoms_114108771  wasn't sufficient.
However_328097 , asymptomatic_42624567  and mild_41563266  cases_17208756  of abortive polio with no_42345165  neurological symptoms_114108771  were usually_3107782  treated_277958  like the flu_113934383 , with plenty_113593557  of fluids_114743189  and bed_rest_11050163 .
The diagnosis_1149750  is_22579744  based_43226171  on the symptoms_114108771  that you have been experiencing_22088655  and the physical_41840808  signs_114110919 , 
for_example_3160083 , the grey_4411536  throat_15478544  membrane_15360299  and swollen_41221114  neck_15477621 .
If your doctor_19872125  thinks_2624298  you may have_264628  diphtheria_113935396 , swabs will be taken from your nose_15528651 , throat_15478544  and any_42344366  skin_15175953  wounds_114107962 , cuts_114096263  or ulcers_114023129  so that the infection_113986195  or bacteria_11332092  can be examined_22111491  under the microscope_13719225  in a laboratory_13589941 .
If the C. diphtheria bacteria_11332092  is found_22134693  so the doctor_19872125  can establish how the illness_113875408  may progress_21974178  and if there are_22579744  any_42344366  risks to anyone the infected_42190227  person_17626  has been in contact with.
Antitoxin_114830480  treatment_1650240  is given_22287600  within the first_41050981  48_42267336  hours_115028658  of symptoms_114108771  developing_22598950  and a blood_15335196  sample_15748975  is also_347757  needed_22602586  to measure_2639347  your antibodies_114829619  to the diphtheria_113935396  toxin_114836246  (poison_114834548 ).
Antibodies_114829619  are_22579744  cells_16300  produced_21737120  by the body_15154650  immune_system_15393243  to fight_off_21120433  diseases_113883821  and infections_113324654 .
A second_42278352  blood_15335196  sample_15748975  will be taken a couple_113590441  of weeks_114970832  later_3156731  to measure_2639347  the antibodies_114829619  again_341086 .
You will be admitted to hospital_13501793  and isolated_2489151  in a separate_4181254  room_14060022  from other_42140352  patients_110250423  so that the disease_113883821  doesn't spread_21367933 .
Antibiotics_12691801  will be given_22287600  to you by injection_1686265  and then_3118752  in tablet_13892329  form_15766180 , to be taken_21145724  by mouth_15239404  for a total_14302138  of 7_42263356 14_42264049  days_114956162 , to kill_21312214  the C. diphtheriae bacteria_11332092 .
You will also_347757  be given_22294885  an injection_114653737  of antitoxin_114830480  to reduce_2424760  the effect_114120355  of the toxins_114836246  (poison_114834548 ) in your body_15154650 .
You will remain_22703136  in isolation_114223181  until you have completely_38032  recovered_42624680  and all_42345966  tests show_2656725  that your body_15154650  is clear of infection_113986195 .
After recovery_113279505 , you will be given_22294885  a booster_12844343  or a full_4541797  course_18262401  of the diphtheria_113935396  vaccine_14463717  before you leave_21991207  the hospital_13501793 .
Anyone who has had close contact_1122359  with an infected_42190227  person_17626  such as household_17968033  members_110153551 , visitors_110596386  and anyone they have kissed_21418987  or had_21414903  sex_1832187  with, should visit_22463694  their GP_19975301  immediately_349076  to be checked for signs_114110919  of diphtheria_113935396 .
This involves_22610758  taking daily_381910  nose_15528651  and throat_15478544  swabs from each_42346315  person_17626  for 7_42263356  days_114956162 .
They will be given_22287600  antibiotic_42716287  treatment_1650240  and a booster_dose_12844343  of the vaccine_14463717  if necessary_41637954 .
The risk of catching_287150  diphtheria_113935396  from work_1578942  colleagues_19789381  or school_friends_110401157  is_22579744  very_332750  low_41259112 .
Diphtheria_113935396  is_22579744  a disease_113883821  that should be prevented_22428989  rather than treated_277958 , but these methods_15590135  are_22579744  effective_4872674  and can control_22486168  the infection_113986195  if the diagnosis_1149750  is made_21740387  early_3101388 .
Treatment_1650240  is_22579744  always_319576  very_332750  urgent_4750777  and should not_324548  be delayed.
People_17834515  with whooping_cough_113956274  are usually_3107782  given_22294885  antibiotics_12691801  to kill_21312214  the bacteria_11332092 .
Even_318086  with antibiotics_12691801 , the bouts_114920490  of coughing_1116903  will probably_3139422  last_22678881  for 6_42263219 8_42263441  weeks_114970832 .
After about_37040  5_42263136  days_114956162  of taking_21145724  antibiotics_12691801 , you will no_longer_332228  be_22579744  infectious_42191146 .
If your child_19771320  has_264628  mild_41563266  whooping_cough_113956274 , they should get_22190280  lots_113593557  of rest_115073413 , drink_21158929  lots_113593557  of fluids_114743189  and stay away_3234576  from other_42140352  children_19771320  while they are_22579744  infectious_42191146  (for two_42262856  weeks_114970832  after the symptoms_114108771  begin).
Clear_away_2178867  any_42344366  excess_41639173  mucus_15349694  or vomit_114660332  so your child_19771976  does not_324548  inhale_21187692  it and choke_276881 .
There is_22579744  no_42345165  drug_13213810  prescribed for chikungunya from the 
World_Health_Organization_18188788  until_now_328631 .
Doctors_19872125  are using_21147708  aspirin_12722943 , ibuprofen_13517303 , combiflam, paracetamol, etc._3104379  to reduce_2424760  the pains_15654390  and the fever_114174023 , but there is_22579744  no_42345165  universally_3196865  acceptable_418488  treatment_1650240  in allopathic_43153428  medicine_15964779  yet_328631 .
Some_42343988  people_17834515  are benefited_22268916  by some_42343988  medication_13698752 , while others are_22579744  not_324548 .
Some_42343988  chikungunya people_17834515  get_2147020  healed_298189  on their own after a few_41608701  days_114956162 .
Hence_342866 , medical_science_15967266  is not_324548  trusted_42548749  enough_42415123  where chikungunya is_22579744  concerned_42042751 .
This has led_22610448  many_41607490  people_17834515  with chikungunya to turn_to_2544360  Ayurveda for seeking_out_21305810  treatment_1650240 .
Ayurveda also_347757  may not_324548  be_22579744  able_41740  to treat_277958  the condition of chikungunya completely_38032 , but it provides_21171470  the necessary_41637954  resistance_114334507  for the body_15154650  to combat_21081652  with the disease_113883821 .
There are_22579744  certain_4737316  Ayurvedic herbs_112037548  that have_22182934  a potential_114289972  to reduce_2424760  the symptoms_114108771  of chikungunya.
Respiratory_illness_113956743  caused_21630835  by influenza_113934383  is_22579744  difficult_4782675  to distinguish_2642357  from illness_113875408  caused_21630835  by other_42140352  respiratory_43189605  pathogens_11368649  on the basis_15722267  of symptoms_114108771  alone_38625 .
However_328097 , during laboratory_13589941 confirmed_2657823  influenza_113934383  outbreaks_17333698 , the majority_15062342  of persons_17626  seeking_22219395  medical_42845379  advice_16582579  for upper_respiratory_tract_15441876  infections_113986195  are_22579744  likely_41463112  to be infected_287875  by influenza_113934383 .
Laboratory_13589941  confirmation_17081401  will be required_22602586  between annual_42710069  influenza_113934383  epidemics_17333958 .
Rapid_41019392  diagnostic_tests_15668395  have recently_3108293  become_2147020  available_4203394  that can be used_21147708  to detect_22134693  influenza_113934383  viruses_11312417  within 30_42265602  minutes_115035576 .
Despite the availability_14663612  of rapid_41019392  diagnostic_tests_15668395 , the collection_11000048  of clinical_42970184  specimens_15749439  for viral_42965033  culture_1907309  remains_2115825  critical_4942587  to provide_21171470  information_18347159  regarding circulating_4700143  influenza_113934383   sub types  and strains_18000941 .
This is needed_22602586  to guide_21913852  decisions_15765349  regarding influenza_113934383  treatment_1650240  and chemoprophylaxis and to formulate_21618693  vaccine_14463717  for the coming_41794511  year_115004692 .
For most_41613064  people_17834515  influenza_113934383  is_22579744  an 
upper_respiratory_tract_15441876  infection_113986195  that lasts_22678881  several_42344948  days_114956162  and requires_22602586  symptomatic_42892404  treatment_1650240  only_34711 .
Within days_114956162 , the person_17626  body_15154650  will eliminate_2465772  the virus_11312417 .
Antibiotics_12691801 , such as penicillin_13866127 , which are designed_2701524  to kill_21312214  bacteria_11332092 , cannot attack_219756  the virus_11312417 .
Therefore_342866  antibiotics_12691801  have no_42345165  role_1709615  in treating_277958  influenza_113934383  in otherwise_42142496  healthy_41216552  people_17834515  although they are used_21147708  to treat_277958  complications_113887502 .
Antiviral_drugs_12699955  for influenza_113934383  are_22579744  an important_41323836  adjunct_19056520  to influenza_113934383  vaccine_14463717  for the treatment_1650240  and prevention_11063016  of influenza_113934383 .
However_328097 , they are_22579744  not_324548  a substitute_15626097  for vaccination_1811799 .
For several_42344948  years_115004692 , four_42263051  antiviral_drugs_12699955  that act_22344645  by preventing_22428989  influenza_113934383  virus_11312417  replication_11005883  have been_22579744  available_4203394 .
They differ_22640699  in terms of their pharmacokinetics_15977178 , side_effects_114120984 , routes_18496118  of administration_1683971 , target_15905038  age_groups_17835861 , dosages_113591257 , and costs_113104779 .
When taken_21145724  before infection_113986195  or during early_4851244  stage_115089620  of the disease_113883821  (within two_42262856  days_114956162  of illness_113875408  onset_17225764 ), antivirals_12699955  may help_22711571  prevent_22428989  infection_113324654 , and if infection_113324654  has already_332511  taken_hold_22417111 , their early_4851244  administration_1683971  may reduce_2424760  the duration_114934750  of symptoms_114108771  by one_42262724  to two_42262856  days_114956162 .
