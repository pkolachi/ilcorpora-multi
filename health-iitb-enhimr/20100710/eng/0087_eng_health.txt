As an adult_19469104 , if you are_22579744  not_324548  sure_4359323  whether or not you have been fully_310491  immunised_285997  (you have not_324548  had_21145724  the full_4541797  five_42263136  doses_13191991 ), see_22464425  your GP_19975301  or 
practical_nurse_110105075 .
They will be_22579744  able_41740  to advise_2863848  you about having a 'catch up' injection_114653737 .
Some_42343988  people_17834515  get_22088655  slight_41610698  swelling_114124199  and redness_114145268  around the site_18502657  of the injection_1319035 , but it usually_3107782  goes_down_21952509  after a few_41608701  days_114956162 .
Other_42140352  side_effects_114120984  can include_22607558  feeling_2104848  a_little_334426  unwell_42625975 , a mild_41563266  headache_114135372 , aches_114132448  and pains_15654390 , and a slight_41610698  fever_114174023 .
However_328097 , these symptoms_114108771  should only_34711  last_22678881  for a 
day_114956162  or two_42262856 .
It is_22579744  rare_4513773  to have_22088655  a severe_41567378  reaction_1846903 .
If you are_22579744  at_all_357118  concerned_4571269  you should discuss_2805257  your symptoms_114108771  with your GP_19975301  or practical_nurse_110105075 .
If you have_22088655  a serious_4683574  wound_114107962  or a wound_114107962  that is_22579744  particularly_384750  dirty_4442026 , then_3119164  you are_22579744  at risk from tetanus_113997452  and you should visit the accident_17201255  and emergency_17316426  department_18004597  of your local_42841627  hospital_13501793  immediately_349076 .
A health_professional_110013819  will ask_2775677  you if you have had_21145724  all_42345966  five_42263136  doses_13191991  of tetanus_113997452  vaccine_14463717 .
If you have not_324548  had_21145724  all_42345966  five_42263136  doses_13191991  then_3119164  they will usually_3107782  give_22287600  you an injection_1319035  of vaccine_14463717 .
Whether or not you have had_21145724  all_42345966  five_42263136  doses_13191991  of vaccine_14463717 , the health_professional_110013819  will assess_2673425  your wound_114107962  and may decide_2689493  that you need_21177503  an injection_1319035  of tetanus_113997452  antiserum_15338954 .
Tetanus_113997452  antiserum_15338954  contains_22604187  antibodies_114829619  that can give_22294885  you additional_451524  protection_1805831  against tetanus_113997452  bacteria_11332092 , but it is_22579744  not_324548  a vaccine_14463717 .
This antiserum_15338954  is used_21147708  as extra_451524  protection_1805831  in cases_17208756  where the wound_114107962  is_22579744  particularly_384750  dirty_4442026 , for_example_3160083  involving_22607836  stable manure, and a large_41434452  amount_15047581  of bacteria_11332092  are_22579744  likely_41463112  to have entered_21998301  the wound_114107962 .
If you have cut_21215725  or burnt_2193385  yourself, or been bitten_21433380 , but your wound_114107962  is_22579744  not_324548  serious_4683574  or particularly_384750  dirty_4442026 , you should check_22509062  whether you have had_21145724  the full_4541797  five_42263136  doses_13191991  of tetanus_113997452  vaccine_14463717 .
If you have not_324548  had_21145724  all_42345966  five_42263136  doses_13191991  you could be_22579744  at risk from tetanus_113997452 .
You should visit your GP_19975301 , or practical_nurse_110105075 , for an injection_1319035  of vaccine_14463717 .
If you do need_21177503  an injection_1319035  of vaccine_14463717  it is_22579744  important_41323836  that you visit your GP_19975301 , or practical_nurse_110105075 , as_322606  soon_334685  as possible_41886604 , preferably_3116655  within two_42262856  days_114956162  of receiving_22088655  your wound_114107962 .
If you have had_21145724  all_42345966  five_42263136  doses_13191991  of tetanus_113997452  vaccine_14463717  and your wound_114107962  is_22579744  not_324548  serious_4683574  or particularly_384750  dirty_4442026 , you are_22579744  not_324548  at risk of tetanus_113997452  and so do not_324548  need_21177503  an additional_451524  injection_1319035  of tetanus_113997452  vaccine_14463717 .
As so many_41607490  different_42141357  viruses_11312417  can cause_21630835  the common_cold_113957149 , no_42345165  vaccination_1811799  against it has yet_328508  been developed_21723473 .
However_328097 , if you have_22088655  a cold_113957149  there are_22579744  some_42343988  things_132870  you can do_22536272  to help_22711571  prevent_22428989  it from spreading_21367933 .
Clean_235249  your hands_15495293  thoroughly_357777  and often_335856 , and teach_2820277  your children_19771976  the importance_15107229  of hand_15495293  washing_1251958 .
Carry_22692848  a bottle_113584548  of alcohol_114514857 based_43226171  hand rub containing_22604187  at_least_3105060  60_42268462  percent_113636179  alcohol_114514857  for times_17209466  when soap_14203074  and water_17828101  aren't available_4203394 .
These gels_114396940  kill_21312214  most_41613064  germs_11367133 , and are_22579744  safe_42128580  for older_41703749  children_19771320  to use_21147708  themselves.
Keep_22655994  kitchen_13579873  and bathroom_12781046  countertops_13086252  clean_4440039 , especially_384750  when someone_17626  in your family_17968033  has_264628  a common_cold_113957149 .
If your child_19771976  has_264628  chickenpox_113944651 , you should inform_2822821  your child_19771976  school_18162936  or  nursery  of the situation_114219716 .
The Health_114256157  Protection_1805831  Agency_18222706  recommends_2865882  that children_19771320  can return_21986635  to school_18162936  or  nursery  once_3182502  the blisters_15449207  have fully_310491  crusted over, and this usually_3107782  happens_2336141  5_42263136 7_42263356  days_114956162  after the first_41050981  blister_15449207  appears_2417790 .
After the last_41053326  blister_15449207  has burst_2305572  and crusted over, children_19771320  are_22579744  no_longer_332228  considered_2682517  infectious_42191146 .
However_328097 , they are_22579744  still_332017  infectious_42191146  up until this time_114923492 .
If you, or your child_19771976  has recently_3108293  been exposed_22092494  to the chickenpox_113944651  virus_11312417 , you may not_324548  be_22579744  able_41740  to visit_22463694  friends_19962226  or relatives_110082774  in hospital_13501793   you should telephone_2780615  the ward_14495456  to check_2911004  first_3103443 .
It is_22579744  also_347757  best_472315  that you, or your child_19771976  avoids_22429425  contact_1122359  with pregnant_4193734  women_110626312 , newborn_babies_110198563 , and anyone who has_22182934  a weak_42402394  immune_system_15393243  (such as people_17834515  having_22088655  chemotherapy_1654008  or those with HIV_113991390  or AIDS_113939458 ).
If your child_19771976  has_264628  chickenpox_113944651 , they may not_324548  be allowed_2793809  to fly_21823023  until six_42263219  days_114956162  after the last_41053326  spot_14627226  has appeared_2417790 ).
Your child_19771976  should be_22579744  safe_42128580  to fly_21823023  once_3182502  they are_22579744  past the infectious_42191146  stage_115089620  and the blisters_15449207  have crusted over, but it is_22579744  best_472315  to check_2911004  your airline_12665430  policy_15826639  first_3103443 .
You should inform_2822821  the airline_12665430  as_322606  soon_334685  as you have sought_22219395  medical_42845379  advice_16582579  and had the illness_113875408  diagnosed_2637804 .
It is_22579744  also_347757  important_41323836  to let_2762842  your insurer_17960500  know_2587430 , to make_sure_22570655  that you will be covered_2881910  if you have to delay_22616607  or cancel_22453876  your holiday_114939001 , or if you need_21177503  to extend_2314311  your stay_11039287  until your child_19771976  is_22579744  well_42624246  enough_3146900  to fly_21823023  home_18440931 .
The chickenpox_113944651  virus_11312417  can sometimes_322353  be spread_21367933  through contact_1122359  with inanimate_4136892  objects_13122 , or items_13548833  that have been infected_42190227  with the virus_11312417 , such as children_19771320  toys_13919884 , bedding_12793343 , or clothing_13021399 .
In order to help_22711571  stop_22535439  the virus_11312417  spreading_21367933 , you can wipe_21380030  any_42344366  objects_13122 , or surfaces_14310273  with a sterilising_261858  solution_114395621 , such as Milton, and make_sure_22570655  that any_42344366  infected_42190227  clothes_12702992 , or bedding_12793343 , are_22579744  clean_4440039  and regularly_3196547  washed_21522375 .
A vaccination_1811799  against typhoid_113956064  was first_3103443  developed_21723473  over a hundred_42272367  years_115004692  ago_41790436 , in 1898 .
Since then_3119035 , vaccines_14463717  have improved_2202077  significantly_36284  and are_22579744  much_359483  less_3100234  likely_41463112  to cause_21630835  side_effects_114120984 .
The vaccine_14463717  works_22501264  by telling your body_15154650  to make antibodies_114829619  against typhoid_113956064  bacteria_11332092 , so that you can fight_off_21120433  the illness_113875408  if you become_2147020  infected_42190227 .
If you are travelling_21828364  to a country_18426193  where standards_15849869  of food_120429  and water_17828101  hygiene may be_22579744  poor_41173827 , such as those in Asia_19075280 , Africa_19057648  and South_America_19304927 , you should have a typhoid_113956064  vaccination_1811799 .
It is_22579744  particularly_384750  important_41323836  to have the vaccination_1811799  if you are backpacking_21908115 , travelling_21818343  on local_42841627  transport_13069266  and staying_21839979  in basic accommodation_12647858 .
There are_22579744  several_42344948  forms_15766180  of vaccine_14463717  that protect_21117411  against Salmonella_typhi_11352710 .
The Typherix or Typhim Vi injections_114653737  are_22579744  the ones most_3112597  commonly_3107782  used_21147708 .
You need_22602586  to have an injection_1319035  at_least_3105060  two_42262856  weeks_114970832  before visiting_21826333  a high risk country_18426193 , in order to allow_22399666  immunity_114334507  to develop_22598950 .
There is_22579744  also_347757  an oral_42856828  vaccine_14463717  called_42511627  Vivotif.
However_329510 , an injection_1319035  is_22579744  easier_4787042  to administer_280270 , only_34711  requires_22602586  a single_4518523  dose_13191991  and lasts_22678881  for three_42262966  years_115004692 .
After this time_114923492 , a booster_dose_12844343  is recommended_2865882  for those still_328097  at risk.
The typhoid_113956064  vaccination_1811799  is_22579744  available_4203394  on the NHS.
However_328097 , you may only be_22579744  able_41740  to get_22190280  a free_41771536  vaccination_1811799  from your GP_19975301  or practical_nurse_110105075 , so it is_22579744  best_472315  to get it done_22537682  before you travel_21828364 .
GP_19975301 s can refuse_2788896  to give_22287600  the vaccine_14463717  if they have chosen_2671933  to opt_out_2671711  of the vaccination_1811799  and immunisation_1816905  additional_451524  service_1572096 .
You therefore_342866  need_21177503  to visit your GP_19975301  surgery_14312239  to check_2911004  that your GP_19975301  is_22579744  able_41740  to provide_21171470  you with a vaccine_14463717 .
Always using_21147708  a condom_13057057  during sex_1832187 , including_22607558  oral_42856828 , and anal_42704663  sex_1832187 , is_22579744  the best_4248569  way_14873611  to prevent_22428989  getting_286898  sexually_3137288  transmitted_22210942  infections_113986195  (STI), including_22607558  HIV_113991390 .
Avoid_22439650  using_21147708  an oil_114769694 based_43226171  lubricant_114693923 , such as Vaseline_14468022  or baby_oil_12740779  because this can weaken_2221826  the condom_13057057 , and increase_2150700  the chances_114291269  of it splitting_2305572 .
Water_17828101 based_43226171  lubricants_114693923  such as KY Jelly are preferred_21809354 , and can be bought_22186766  at most_41613064  supermarkets_14306955 , or pharmacists.

fits_22634447  in your mouth_15239404   can also_347757  be used_21147708  during oral_sex_1842816  to prevent_22428989  the spread_17344276  of infection_113324654 .
You should always_319576  clean_21519718  sex toys after each_42346315  use_1933270 , and also_347757  after using_21147708  them on different_42141357  parts_113628130  of the body_15154650 .
They should also_347757  be cleaned_21519718  in between_3501357  being used_21147708  by one_42262724  partner_110481166 , and the other.
It is_22579744  important_4688962  to continue_22659138  to practice_22544290  safe_sex_1831981  even_318086  if you, and your sexual_42209621  partner_110481166 , both have_264628  HIV_113991390 .
This is_22579744  because it is_22579744  possible_41886604  to expose_22092494  yourself to a new_42141686  strain_18000941  of the virus_11312417  that your antiHIV medicine_13698752  will not_324548  be_22579744  able_41740  to control_22486168 .
Knowingly_3239003  infecting_288912  somebody_17626  with HIV_11320298  is_22579744  a criminal_41454274  offence_1758711 .
If you inject_285500  drugs_13213810 , avoid_22439650  sharing_22273977  needles_13773495  because it could expose_22092494  you to HIV_11320298 , as well as other_42140352  bloodborne viruses_11312417 , such as hepatitis_C_113943029 . 
Many_41607490  local_41149112  authorities_17941270  and pharmacies_13215532  offer_22275070  needle_13773495  exchange_11151051  programmes_15824218 , where used_41699909  needles_13773495  can be_22579744  exchanged_4377764  for clean_4440039  ones.

As impetigo_114039147  is_22579744  very_332750  contagious_41351382  it is_22579744  important_4688962  to take_22575056  hygiene_114302461  precautions_1811103  to stop_22535439  the bacteria_11332092  spreading_21367933  and prevent_22428989  other_42140352  people_17834515  catching_287150  it.
In the United_States_18915715 , it's currently_348605  recommended_2865882  that children_19771320  have_21145724  four_42263051  doses_13191991  of inactivated polio_113951824  vaccination (IPV_14084071 ) between the ages_114946104  of 2_42262856  months_115007086  and 6_42263219  years_115004692 .
By 1964 , the oral polio vaccine (OPV_14075870 ), developed_21723473  by Albert_Sabin_111113335 , had become_2147020  the recommended_472574  vaccine_14463717 .
OPV_14075870  allowed_22399666  large_41434452  populations_113598844  to be immunized because it was_22579744  easy_4787042  to administer_280270 , and it provided_21171470  "contact" immunization_1816905 , which means_22609808  that an unimmunized person_17626  who came_2536727  in contact_1122359  with a recently_3108293  immunized_42444336  child_19771320  might become_2147020  immune_42444139 , too_347757 .
The problem_114219078  with OPV_14075870  was_22579744  that, in very_332750  rare_4513773  cases_17208756 , paralytic polio could develop_22598950  either in immunized_42444336  children_19771320  or in those who came_2536727  in contact_1122359  with them.
Since 1979  (when wild polio was eliminated_22603908  in the United_States_18915715 ), the approximately_37040  10_42263664  cases_17208756  per year_115004692  of polio_113951824  seen_22109242  in this country_18426193  were traced_2720779  to OPV_14075870 .
IPV_14084071  is_22579744  a vaccine_14463717  that stimulates_2498010  the 
immune_system_15393243  of the body_15154650  (through production_1899833  of antibodies_114829619 ) to fight_21080713  the virus_11312417  if it comes_2536727  in contact_1122359  with it.
In an effort_1774657  to eradicate_21647134  all_42345966  polio_113951824 , including_22607558  those cases_17208756  associated_42042200  with the vaccine_14463717 , the Center_for_Disease_Control_and_Prevention_18014328  (CDC_18014328 ) decided_2689493  to make_2118050  IPV_14084071  the only_42290770  vaccine_14463717  given_22287600  in the United_States_18915715 .
Currently_348605 , the CDC_18014328  and American_43011995  Academy_12645609  of Pediatrics_15983223  (AAP) recommend_2865882  three_42262966  spaced_4569948  doses_13191991  of IPV_14084071  given_22287600  before the age_114946104  of 18_42264422  months_115007086 , and an IPV_14084071  booster_12844343  given_22287600  between the ages_114946104  of 4_42263051  to 6_42263219 , when children_19771320  are entering_21071889  school_15686799 .
If you're planning_2696574  to travel_21828364  outside the United_States_18915715 , particularly_384750  to Africa_19057648  and Asia_19075280  (where polio_113951824  still_332017  exists_22578719 ), be_22579744  sure_4359323  that you and your child_19771976  have received_22189688  a complete_4546929  set_17888016  of polio_113951824  vaccinations_1811799 .

Booster_doses_12844343  are given_22287600  between the ages_114946104  of 3_42262966  and 5_42263136  and again between 16_42264235  and 18_42264422  years_115004692 .
Diphtheria_113935396  epidemics_17333958  still_328097  occur_2336141  in countries_18426193  where only_34711  some of the population_18066746  are_22579744  immunised_42444336 , and people_17834515  travelling_21828364  to these areas_18379933  may pick up the disease_113883821 .
There are_22579744  more_than_41611077  120_42272917  countries_18426193  for which travellers_19492533  are recommended_2865882  to protect_21117411  themselves by vaccination_1811799  against diphtheria_113935396 .
It is_22579744  very_332750  important_4688962  that babies_19682781  get_2147020  immunised_42444336  against whooping_cough_113956274 .
This is_22579744  an inactive version_15767672  of the infection_113986195  and the body_15154650  produces_21737120  antibodies_114829619  to fight it so that you are_22579744  then_3118752  immune_42444139  to it.
Immunity_114334507  wears_off_2464453  after a while, so children_19771320  have a 
booster_12844343  jab before they start school_15686799 .
The reason_19047424  that babies_19682781  are given_22294885  these jabs when they are so_3147781  young_41706638  is_22579744  because young_41706638  babies_19682781  are most_3112597  seriously_315978  affected_219468  by diseases_113883821  such as 
whooping_cough_113956274 .
The jabs are_22579744  very_332750  safe_42128580  and it is_22579744  unlikely_41465532  that your baby_19682781  will have_264628  any_42344366  side_effects_114120984 .
However_328097 , if your baby_19682781  does have_264628  side_effects_114120984 , they may include_22607558  irritability_17450141 , a fever_114174023  and slight_41610698  swelling_114124199  where the needle_13773495  went_in_21998301 .
The aedes_aegypti_12179538  mosquito_12178886 , considered_2682517  as the prime_41053073  culprit of causing_21630835  the disease_113883821 , is_22579744  actually_3150716  a localized_41478140  insect_12138820 .
In its whole_4541319  lifetime_114941516 , it does not_324548  travel_21818343  even_317488  a quarter_113556708  of a kilometer_113479608 .
Hence_342866 , it is_22579744  not_324548  the mosquito_12178886  that is_22579744  the cause_17127  of the epidemic_17333958 .
Chikungunya becomes_2147020  an epidemic_17333958  through people_17834515  who travel_1291908  from an affected_476117  area_18379933  to an unaffected_477186  area_18379933 .
For this reason_16649321 , it is_22579744  very_332750  necessary_41637954  to regulate_2295855  travelers_19492533 , especially_384750  those who are emigrating_2411852  from a place_18543623  that has_22182934  several_42344948  cases_17208756  of chikungunya.
Vaccination_1811799  is_22579744  the principal_41325646  measure_1170956  for preventing_22428989  influenza_113934383  and reducing_2424760  the impact_111249821  of epidemics_17333958 .

The effectiveness_15137796  of influenza_113934383  vaccine_14463717  depends_22638691  primarily_374239  on the age_114946104  and immunocompetence_113788121  of the vaccine_14463717  recipient_19490691  and the degree_15034128  of similarity_14688000  between the viruses_11312417  in the vaccine_14463717  and those in circulation_111274325 .
