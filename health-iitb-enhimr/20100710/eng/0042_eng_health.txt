Hampered_21074757  in this way_14873611 , we breathe_in_25041  only_34711  an estimated_2664380  one_tenth_113557524  of our oxygen_114454163  requirement_19232770  and use approximately_37040  1 /3 rd of our lung_15322893  capacity_113598414 .
The average_41652635  civilized_4434546  individual_17626  today_348812  is not_324548  breathing_21740  but merely_34711  avoiding_22429425  suffocation_113857667 .
There is_22579744  a belief_15841869  among the superstitious_41997119  that every_42346474  one_15795834  of us is_22579744  born_41795551  with a certain_4737316  count_113417015  of breaths_114646273 .
When the number_15061203  of these breaths_114646273  is completed_2479055  one has to leave_21991207  this world_19138104 .
By breathing_21740  12_42263833 13_42263956  times_1859425 , the count_113417015  will be_22579744  slow_41020319  and you will go a long way.
It seems_22113647  logical_41482652 ; if you breathe_21740  slowly_3162675  and deeply_3307643 , health_113737741  will improve_2202077 .
With better_4251307  health_114256157  you are_22579744  bound_4363282  to cross all_42345966  your limits_113577172 .
This type_15767228  of breathing_1819106  raises_21955745  only_34711  the ribs_15215986 , top_18543040  of the shoulders_15479858  and the collar_bone_15211101 .
The breath_114646273  is introduced_21409390  only_34711  in the upper_41252617  part_113628130  of the lungs_15322893 .
As this is_22579744  the smallest_41443454  part_113628130 , only_34711  a little_41443454  amount_15047581  of air_114645770  reaches_22002368  the lungs_15322893 .
Working_21512822  in this way_14873611  2_42262856 3_42262966  hours_115028658 , there cannot be_22579744  any_42344366  other_42140352  way_14873611  except "upper" breathing_1819106 .
Lift_21955745  your shoulders_17556476  a little_3100709  and breathe_21740  deeply_3307643 .
Let_22399666  your shoulder_15479858  fall and throw_back_21500232  your head_15469706 , and you will see_2591374  that you can breathe_in_25041  still_317682  more_41611077 .
Now sit_21530257  at a table_14327412 , leaning_22020053  over forward_374983  a_bit_334426 , just_3159561  as we do_22536272  while working_22389840 .
Breathing_1819106  will be_22579744  shallow_4729002  as the shoulders_15479858  are_22579744  in an unnatural_41628453 , high_41250892  position_15020713 .
It involves_22602586  little_41610318  of abdominal_breathing_1821211 .
The middle_4353016  lungs_15322893  are filled_2447583  instead of the upper_41252617  lungs_15322893 .
This is_22579744  the way_14873611  most_41613064  men_110135377  breathe_21740  when they stand_21533085  erect_41283004  or sit_21530257  in a crowded_4588826  room_14060022 , or cinema_13002258  .
We have to resort_22565493  to hasty_41318649 , short_41494564  breathing_1819106 .
Observe_22149635  yourself, next_4145998  time_17209466  you are_22629830  in a cinema_13002258 .
This can be seen_22136410  best_3189500  in animals_115024  like a horse_12352486  or dog_12064081  which use_21147708  thoracic_42945460  breathing_1819106  during exertion_1615918 .

Most_41613064  men_110135377  breathe_21740  this way_14873611  when lying_down_21966712  or resting_21532857 .
It is_22579744  the most_3112597  efficient_4878282  of the three_42262966  ways_14873611  of breathing_1819106  but still_328097  inadequate_454324 .
The purest_41974444  form_15766180  of abdominal_breathing_1821211  is found_22134693  in strong_42399006  healthy_41216552  men_110135377 , soldiers_110462567 , athletes_19675378 , farmers_19928995  and mountain_19225394  shepherds_110428192 .
The diaphragm_15254787  plays_22347932  an important_41323836  role_1709615  since it is_22579744  a strong_42399006  partition of muscles_15225981  separating_22596733  the chest_15483589  and the abdomen_15489137 .
