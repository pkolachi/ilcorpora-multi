Dr. Offit noted_21009923  that the cost_113104779  of immunization_1816905  for those at low risk would be approximately $80  to avoid a 1  in 125 ,000  chance of infection and a 1  in 1 ,250 ,000  chance of death or severe sequela.
The current vaccine does not provide protection from group B meningococcal disease, the strain most common in young infants.
the good news is that the relative incidence of group B disease has decreased from 43 % in 1990  to 1992  to 34 % in 1997  to 2003  for all meningococcal infection.
The chickenpox vaccine was approved for use in 1995  by the FDA. 
The chickenpox vaccine was not until 1998  that more than 50 % of children were being given this vaccine.
Approval was followed immediately by a recommendation from both for the private (AAP) and public sector (ACIP) to immunize all children at age 12  to 18  months.
Subsequent efforts were directed at "catchup" immunization and by the year 2000 , significant reductions in incidence of disease were appreciated.
newer data supporting the efficacy of these routine vaccination efforts, but there are still unresolved issues with the chickenpox vaccine, as reviewed by Dr. Anne Gershon,[4 ] Columbia University, New York, New York.
Dr. Gershon noted that recent studies have indicated an 85 % protection rate against disease, with modified illness observed in the remainder of children immunized.
Most important, data has shown a 97 % rate of protection against severe disease.
In the postvaccine era, the Centers for Disease Control reported 66  annual deaths vs 145  each year before 1995 , when the vaccine was introduced.
"Although some studies show no increase in breakthrough varicella [rates] with time, others do," according to Gershon.
"There have been a few reports of breakthrough outbreaks of chickenpox in day care centers and schools."
in the United States, immunologic followup of vaccine recipients has indicated persistence of antibody and cellmediated immune responses to varicellazoster virus for 5  to 10  years postvaccination.
reason for vaccine failure could include improper storage of vaccine.
Additionally, some data suggest that immunization before the age of 15  months is associated with reduced protective efficacy.
Currently, CDC is considering recommending a second dose of VZ vaccine to increase protection.
Reasons for this include both reported breakthrough cases and because a booster dose at age 4  to 6  years has been shown to increase serum antibody titers almost 6 fold.
The recently approved combination vaccine MMR/VZ would allow this booster dose to be given at the same time the required second dose of MMR vaccine is normally administered, without increasing the total number of injections.
Reactivation of zoster infection is less common among vaccinees than among those who had natural infection, including rates among immunocompromised individuals.
There is 1  interesting associated factor for subsequent zoster, explained Dr. Gershon, which was first observed in leukemic vaccinees.
That factor is a rash that developed shortly after vaccine administration.
In a group of study patients with leukemia, 3 .6 % who had the rash developed zoster, although only 0 .4 % without the rash subsequently had reactivation disease.
A new zoster vaccine, which has a much lower amount of VZ virus than the childhood vaccine, has been shown to reduce disease and the severity of its clinical manifestations.
Among 38 ,000  volunteers over aged 60 , half of whom received vaccine, 315  developed zoster compared with 642  of the controls.
There was also a 61 % reduction in pain or discomfort with the acute infection and a 66 % reduction in postherpetic neuralgia.
Dr. Gershon suggested that if an unacceptable incidence of zoster among the population vaccinated in childhood, the new zoster vaccine could be given to adults in the 40  to 50 year age range.
A number of current recommendations from the AAP Red Book Committee are relevant to the administration of vaccines to children with asthma, eczema, and immune deficiency
Children with eczema can receive all currently recommended vaccines unless they are receiving corticosteroids at a total dose > 20  mg/day or > 2  mg/kg if they weigh less than 10  kg.
Respective amounts of corticosteroids are immunosuppressive in all individuals, so are generally a contraindication for administration of live virus vaccines.
most immune deficient patients should not receive live vaccines.
Exceptions are those with selective IgA or IgG subclass deficiencies and those with AIDS who are not severely immunosuppressed.
Recommendations for patients on immunosuppressive chemotherapy are problematic because there are limited data to guide decisions.
Individual oncology programs often establish protocols for their patients based on their clinical experience and their interpretation of the literature.
Individual oncology programs often establish protocols for their patients based on their clinical experience and their interpretation of the literature.
Generally, vaccines should be withheld at least 3  months after chemotherapy is discontinued and longer when treatment was with the more immunosuppressive regimens.
Testing of immune function can be used to individualize decisions about use of vaccines.
All pediatricians are concerned with vaccine safety issues and immunization hesitancy.
In an extensive survey questionnaire of parents, the most consistent misconception (25 % of respondents) leading to refusal of immunizations was that the immune system of children would be weakened by receipt of too many vaccines.
the survey showed that concerns with mercury have decreased considerably, likely a result of extensive educational efforts by the AAP over the past few years.
Sustaining the immunization consensus among professional organizations.
Providing access to immunizations for all children at their medical home.
The best strategy for assuring vaccine compliance is to require immunizations for school entry or continuation.
The federal government provides strong support for routine administration of recommended vaccines, individual states currently vary in their vaccine documentation for school entry.
All states require diphtheria, tetanus, polio, measles, and rubella; all but 6  states require pertussis and all but 5  require hepatitis B immunization.
Other currently recommended vaccines (mumps, Haemophilus influenza B, chickenpox, pneumococcus, meningococcus, and the booster dose of pertussis) are required in just a few states.
Conversely, childcare centers are generally much more strict in their vaccine requirements than are state school systems.
Dr. Marcuse also pointed out that individual states vary in their laws regarding exemptions for immunization.
All 50  states support medical exclusions; 49  allow religious and 20  allow personal or philosophical exemptions.
Another important issue discussed was the approach to parents who refuse vaccines for their children.
Clinicians certainly want to provide ideal healthcare to all of their patients and have difficulty accepting any limitation toward these efforts.
There are significant differences in the philosophy of care.
Multiple attempts have been made to change the parent's decision.
Before a patient can be discharged from a healthcare facility, advance notice must be given and an alternative for access to care must be discussed and documented.
