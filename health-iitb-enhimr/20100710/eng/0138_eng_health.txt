A mother_110178093  death_17254694  is_22579744  a tragedy_17214657  unlike others, because of the deeply_3174633  held_2675674  feeling_125099  that no one should die_2354455  in the course_18262401  of the normal_41652138  process_11009596  of reproduction_113376112  and because of the devastating_4616781  effects_111246064  on her family_17968033 .

In some, the situation_113741363  has actually_3150716  worsened_2200897  in recent_41792372  years_115004692 .
Progress_1245749  has therefore_3296032  been_22579744  patchy_4951287  and unless it is accelerated_2434729  significantly_3513244 , there is_22579744  little_41443454  hope_17409610  of reducing_2424760  maternal_41797695  mortality_115076439  by three quarters and child_19771320  mortality_115076439  by two_thirds_113556606  by the target_15905038  date_114960543  of 2015   the targets_15905038  set_2691719  by the Millennium Declaration_16635639 .

The reasons_16649321  for this are_22579744  complex_42252594  and vary_22636971  from one_42262724  country_18426193  to another.
They include_22607558  the familiar_41005109 , persistent_4623834  enemies of health_114256157   poverty_114300525 , inequality_14696363 , war_1959164  and civil_42783492  unrest_113793671 .
The destructive_4616347  influence_111250018  of HIV_113991390 /AIDS_113939458   but also_347757  the failure_114285193  to translate_22728412   lifesaving  knowledge_122178  into effective_4872674  action_135807  and to invest_22249766  adequately_3146822  in public_4518360  health_114256157  and a safe_42128580  environment_113748560 .
This leaves_22705088  many_41607490  mothers_110178093  and children_19771976 , particularly_384750  the poorest_42094206  among them, excluded_2607944  from access_15114433  to the affordable_4974790 , effective_4872674  and responsive_42181680  care_1648004  to which they are_22579744  entitled_4891187 .
For centuries_115006433 , care_1648004  for childbirth_113275547  and young_41706638  children_19771320  was regarded_2682517  as a domestic_41079419  affair_15601239 , the realm_114322093  of mothers_110178093  and midwives_110160953 .
In the 20 th_42280832  century_115006433 , the health_114256157  of mothers_110178093  and children_19771976  was transformed_2378621  from a purely_3180290  domestic_43004382  concern_15600606  into a public_4518360  health_114256157  priority_113763714  with corresponding_42043298  responsibilities_11114574  for the state_18065574 .
In the opening_41049138  years_115043767  of the 21 st_42280939  century_115006433 , the Millennium_114942324  Development_1246507  Goals_15904683  place_21481373  it at the core_18129272  of the struggle_1777440  against poverty_114300525  and inequality_14696363 , as a matter_15601239  of human_rights_15115800 .

The creation_1895381  of public_4518360  health_114256157  programmes_15824218  to improve_2202884  the health_113737741  of women_110626312  and children_19771976  has its origins_18389765  in Europe_19142657  at the end_115066306  of the nineteenth_42280588  century_115006433 .
Healthy_41057629  mothers_110178093  and children_19771976  were seen_2682517  by governments_17941270  at that time_114923492  to be_22579744  a resource_15093625  for economic_42803023  and political_41878927  ambitions_17382434 .
Many of Europe_19142657  politicians_110294951  shared_22694055  a perception_15763659  that the illhealth_113865826  of the nation_18056156  children_19771320  threatened_22671089  their cultural_42957495  and military_41571355  aspirations_17382434 .
This feeling_125099  was_22579744  particularly_384750  strong_42399006  in France_18802093  and Britain_18733354 , which had experienced_22090675  difficulties_1618153  in recruiting_22447448  soldiers_110462567  fit_41060892  enough_3146900  for war_1959164 .

These programmes_15824218  offered_22275070  a scientific_42155869  and convincing_4646382  way_1169254  to produce_21737120  healthy_41216552  children_19771976  who would become_2147020  productive_41931380  workers_19495263  and robust_42108886  soldiers_110462567 .
