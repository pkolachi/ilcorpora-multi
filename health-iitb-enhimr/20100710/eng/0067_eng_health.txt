Typhoid_fever_113956064  is usually_3107782  diagnosed_2637804  by conducting_22421850  tests_1779545  on a patient_110250423  stools_114658602 , blood_15335196  or urine_114660064 .
If the typhoid_113956064  bacterium_11332092  is detected_22134693 , a correct_4663314  diagnosis_1149750  can be made_21630835 .
The symptoms_114108771  of typhoid_113956064  can be similar_42142615  to those of malaria_113891291 , so this should be ruled_out_2677322  as_322606  soon as possible_41886604 .
Typhoid_fever_113956064  is mainly_374239  caught_287150  abroad_3104718 , so it is useful_42579357  for your doctor_19872125  to know_2587430  your recent_41792372  travel_1291908  history_114922667 .
As typhoid_fever_113956064  can be fatal_41033404 , early_4855595  diagnosis_1149750  and treatment_1650240  is crucial_4688962 .
In developed_41350180  countries_18056156 , antibiotics_12691801  such as ampicillin_12680955  and chloramphenicol_12991919  are often_335856  used_21153919  to treat_277958  the infection_113324654 .
You may need_21177891  to be admitted_22478434  to hospital_13501793 , if you are infected_288912  with the typhoid_113956064  bacterium_11332092  while abroad_3104718 .
If you are unable_4330031  to eat_21157345 , due_to_4192257  gastrointestinal_43058672  (stomach_15331039  and gut_15465549 ) problems_15617278 , you may be given an intravenous_drip_17331289 .
In severe_41567378  cases of typhoid_fever_113956064 , corticosteroids_114557280  may be needed_22602586  to reduce_2424760  the inflammation_114145268  of your brain_15413129 .
If you are admitted_22478434  to hospital_13501793 , you will be cared_for_277958  in isolation_114223181  and your family_17862221  members_110153551 ' stools_114658602  may be examined_2636835  to see_2591374  if they are carrying_22722194  the disease_113883821 .
While undergoing_22088655  treatment_1650240 , maintaining_22655994  good_469565  general_41478509  hygiene_114302461  is important_4688962  as bacteria_11332092  may continue_22659138  to be present_41912209  in your body_15154650 .
People_17834515  with typhoid_fever_113956064 , who are treated_277958  with antibiotics_12691801 , usually_3107782  improve_2202077  within 2_42262856 3_42262966  days_114956162  and death_17254694  is extremely_390086  rare_4513773 .
However_328097 , if you have had_22088655  the infection_113324654 , you may still_328097  be carrying_22722194  the bacteria_11332092  in your system_15157385 .
Therefore_342866 , if you have been treated_277958  for typhoid_113956064  abroad_3104718 , you should have your stools_114658602  examined_2636835  when you return_21986635 .
If your job_1576963  involves_22602586  handling_21199418  food_120429 , you should stay_off_2803035  work_1578942  until at_least_3105060  two_42262856  stool_114658602  samples_15748975  are clear of the bacterium_11332092 .
Usually_3107782  penicillin_13866127  is preferred_2671356 , but erythromycin_13260382 , tetracycline_14364451 , or chloramphenicol_12991919  can also_347757  be used_21147708 .
To be effective_4872674 , treatment_1650240  should be initiated_21613968  early_3101388 .
If left_22705088  untreated_42025631 , the disease_113883821  can be fatal_41033404 .
There is currently_348605  one_42262724  anthrax_114069546  vaccine_14463717  for humans_12450463  licensed_4199264  for use_15088491  in the United_States_18915715 .
Because anthrax_114069546  is considered_2682517  to be a potential_446761  agent_19059148  for use_1933270  in biological_warfare_1953867 , the Department_of_Defense_18021209  recently_3108293  announced_2956159  that it would begin_2341793  systematic_42463489  vaccination_1811799  of all_42345966  US_18915715  military_personnel_18282713 .
Among civilians_19778195 , anthrax_114069546  vaccine_14463717  is recommended_2865882  for individuals_17626  who come in contact_137654  in the workplace_14547119  with imported_41076371  animal_115024  hides_114565108 , furs_114569768 , bonemeal_114588342 , wool_14544529 , animal_115024  hair_15191825  (especially_384750  goat_12394329  hair_15191825 ), and bristles_11882334 ; and for individuals_17626  engaged_4315697  in diagnostic_43058464  or  investigational  activities_1403481  which may bring_21426411  them into contact_137654  with anthrax_114069546  spores_111381247 .
The vaccine_14463717  should only_3508047  be administered_280270  to healthy_41216552  men_110133569  and women_110626312  from 18_42264422  to 65_42268940  years_115004692  of age.
Because it is not_324548  known_2587430  whether the anthrax_114069546  vaccine_14463717  can cause_21630835  fetal_42977535  harm_1399024 , pregnant_4193734  women_110626312  should not_324548  be vaccinated_285997 .
The vaccine_14463717  is reported_2955678  to be 93_42271683 % effective_4872674  in protecting_21117411  against cutaneous_anthrax_113886086 .
Anthrax_114069546  vaccines intended_2701278  for use_1933270  in animals_115024  should not_324548  be used_21147708  in humans_12450463 .
HIV_113991390  can be very_332750  difficult_4782675  to diagnose_2637804  from the symptoms_114108771  alone_38625 .
Sometimes_322353 , even_317488  specialists_110473000  who are experienced_4975187  in treating_277958  HIV_113991390  can mistake_2609954  the symptoms_114108771  for another_42141203  condition_114353545 .
Therefore_342866 , if you are in a high_41257379  risk_114349152  group_129714  for catching_287150  HIV (see_22109658  below_380296 ), it is very_332750  important_41323836  that you have a HIV_113991390  test.
The earlier_3259926  HIV_113991390  is diagnosed_2637804 , the more_3100048  likely_3139422  it is that treatment_1650240  will be successful_42409920 .
In the past_114922178 , many_41607490  people_17834515  were reluctant_42650736  to take a HIV_113991390  test because they thought that if they were diagnosed_2637804  with the condition_114353545 , there was nothing_324732  that could be done_21697549  to help_2203996  them.
However_328097 , this is not_324548  true_42543276  and there are now_349572  medicines_13698752  available_4203394  which can be used_21147708  to slow_2436172  the progress_1278298  of HIV_113991390  and effectively_3328528  manage_22562773  the condition_114353545 .
HIV_113991390  can be diagnosed_2637804  by testing_22508889  your blood_15335196  for the presence_113771566  of the virus_11312417 .
However_328097 , the test will only_34711  detect_22134693  HIV_113991390  after three_42262966  months_115007086  have passed_22054525  since the initial_41052110  infection_113324654 .
Therefore_342866 , it will usually_3107782  be recommended_2865882  that you have another_42141203  test three_42262966  months_115007086  after your first_41050981  one.
You should not_324548  assume_2624797  that any previous_4145187  blood_test_15671903  that you have had was used_21147708  to check_22509062  for the presence_113771566  of HIV_113991390 .
Blood_15335196  is only_3508047  tested_22508889  for HIV_113991390  if you specifically_341621  consent_2789163  to testing_22508889 .
The results_17192761  of your HIV_113991390  test will remain_2115825  strictly_3180290  confidential_41925638 .
However_328097 , if you are diagnosed_2637804  with HIV_113991390 , and you have health_113737741 , or life,_insurance_113175679 , your insurance_company_17960500  will have to be informed_2822821 .
If you do have HIV_113991390 , it is important_4688962  that your current_4699223  sexual_42212218  partner_110481166 , or any_42344366  sexual_42212218  partner_110481166  that you have had since being exposed_21025831  to infection_113324654 , is tested_22508889  and treated_277958 .
Some_42343988  people_17834515  can feel_21754776  angry_4132472 , upset_42539330 , or embarrassed_4505420  about discussing_2805257  HIV_113991390  with their current_4699223  or former_41791508  partner_110481166 , or partners_110481166 .
You should not_324548  be afraid_483590  to discuss_2805257  your concerns_15759473  with your GP_19975301  or the clinic_17944416  staff_18324833 .
They will be able_41740  to advise_2863848  you about who should be contacted_2734887  and the best_4248569  way_1169254  to contact_2734887  them.
With your permission_16599823 , your clinic_17944416  will be able_41740  to arrange_21011547  for a 'contact_137654  slip_14190424 ' to be given to your former_41791508  partner_110481166 , or partners_110481166 .
The slip_14190424  explains that they may have been exposed to a sexually transmitted infection, and advises them to have a checkup.
The slip_14190424  does not_324548  have your name_16248892  on it, and your details_15745084  will remain_2115825  totally_38032  confidential_41925638 .
Nobody can force_22480419  you to tell_2999158  any_42344366  of your partners_110481166  about your HIV_113991390 , but it is strongly_3178494  recommended_2865882  that you do_21697549 .
Left_22705088  untested_41702551  and untreated_42025631 , HIV_113991390  can have devastating_4617807  consequences_111246064  and will eventually_347864  lead_22610448  to death_17254694 .
The  viral load  will be regularly_3196547  measured_2639347   in order to  show_2656725  whether the medicines_13698752  that are being used_21147708  to treat_277958  HIV_113991390  are working_21512822  effectively_3328528 .
A high_41257379   viral load  may mean_22609808  that you need_22602586  a new_42141686  combination_17855596  of medicines_13698752 .
Both_42344813  the CD4_114691793  count_113417015  and  viral load  can fluctuate_2267320  over time_114923492 , so one_42262724  high_41257379 , or low_41259112 , reading_15744029  does not_324548  automatically_35592  mean_22609808  that your condition_113735349  has got_2147020  worse_4253022 .
The general_41905376  trend_18560781  of your CD4_114691793  count_113417015  and  viral load , over time_114923492 , is more_3100048  important_42238654  in tracking_21894239  the progression_17343663  of the condition_114353545 .
There is no_42345165  cure_14028651 , or vaccine_14463717 , for HIV_113991390 , and researchers_110365186  believe_2675183  it will be many_41607490  years_115004692 , if not_324548  decades_115005884 , before either is found_22134693 .
However_328097 , special_42354665  medicines_13698752  that are used_21147708  in what is known_2587146  as highly_active_antiretroviral_therapy_13214750  (HAART_13214750 ) has proved_2656725  remarkably_3108107  successful_42409920  in slowing_2436172  the progression_17343663  of the condition_114353545 , and prolonging_22653729  life_113775382 .
Researchers_110365186  are confident_4359664  that continuing_4628751  improvements_17256591  in therapy_1652939  will mean_22609808  that a person_17626  with HIV_113991390  will have the same_42133685  lifespan_114941516  as somebody who does not_324548  have the condition_114353545 . The therapy_1652939  involves_22602586  using_21147708  a combination_17855596  of medicines_13698752 .
This is because HIV_113991390  can quickly_3106318  adapt_2147724  and become_2147020  resistant_42444139  to one_42262724  single_4518523  medicine_13698752 .
These medicines_13698752  work_22501264  in different_41461974  ways_14873611 , but they are all_42345966  designed_2701524  to interrupt_2769609  the reproductive_41123281  cycle_17241828  of the virus_11312417   in order to  slow_down_2436172  its spread_17344276 , and protect_21117411  your immune_system_15393243 .
Most_41613064  people_17834515  with HIV_113991390  are recommended_2865882  to take two_42262856  types_15767228  of medication_13698752  from the NRTIs_13792099  class_17889030 , plus a medicine_13698752  from another_42141203  class_17889030 .
The goal_15904683  of treatment_1650240  is to find_21623484  the best_4248569  combination_17855596  of medicines_13698752 , while minimising_2423502  any_42344366  side_effects_114120984 .
In some_42343988  people_17834515 , the medicines_13698752  that are used_21147708  to treat_277958  HIV_113991390  will cause_21630835  side_effects_114120984 .
However_328097 , the side_effects_114120984  tend_22695145  to improve_2202077  after a few_41608701  weeks_114970832  as your body_15154650  gets used_22347413  to the medicines_13698752 .
Protease_inhibitors_13968834  have been known_41425939  to increase_2150700  the levels_15034128  of cholesterol_114860674  and sugar_114598144  in the blood_15335196 , which can lead_22610448  to the hardening_114173153  of your arteries_15269471  (arteriosclerosis_113920647 ).
Arteriosclerosis_113920647  will increase_2150700  your chances_1791097  of developing_293465  a cardiovascular_disease_113870974 , such as heart_disease_113915611 , or stroke_113895746 .
Eating_21155228  a healthy_42642483  diet_17458514 , taking regular_4514962  exercise_1619029 , and not_324548  smoking_1822551 , will help_22711571  to reduce_2424760  the risk_114349152  of developing_293465  arteriosclerosis_113920647 .
You may also_347757  be given_22287600  special_42354665  medicines_13698752  to help_22711571  further_330698  reduce_2424760  the risk_114349152 .
These include_22607558  medicines_13698752  known_as_42511488  statins_13635351  that can reduce_2424760  the level_15034128  of cholesterol_114860674  in your blood_15335196 .

Some_42343988  anti_41882018 HIV_113991390  medicines_13698752  have been known_41425939  to cause_21630835  damage_17319791  to the nerves_15406831  in the hands_15495293  and feet_15493969 , a condition_114353545  known_as_42511488  peripheral_4353938  neuropathy_114019961 .
This can cause_21630835  your hands_15495293  and feet_15493969  to feel_22086634  numb_42177929 , or tingly.
You should report_2955678  any_42344366  such symptoms_114108771  straight_away_349076  as your treatment_1650240  plan_15823699  will need_22602586  to be changed_2123976   in order to  prevent_22428989  further_4467497  nerve_15406831  damage_17319791 .
If you find_22134693  that the side_effects_114120984  from HIV_113991390  treatment_1650240  are adversely_3261948  affecting_2134917  your quality_14672645  of life_113775382 , you should inform_2822821  the staff_18324833  at your HIV_113991390  clinic_17944416 .
It may be possible_41886604  to change_2158439  your medicines_13698752 , or other_42140352  medicines_13698752  may be available_4203394  that can relieve_281725  any_42344366  side_effects_114120984 .
The medicines_13698752  used_21147708  to treat_277958  HIV_113991390  are only_3508047  effective_4872674  when taken_21145724  exactly_3159561  as prescribed_2738660 .
Missing_2607346  even_317488  a few_41608701  doses_13191991  will increase_2150700  the risk_114349152  of your treatment_1650240  not_324548  working_22501264 .
For example_15861689 , some_42343988  medicines_13698752  you will be given_22287600  should only_3508047  be taken_21145724  on an empty_41128234  stomach_15331039 , while others need_22602586  to be taken_21145724  with food_120429 .
You will need_22602586  to develop_21723473  a daily_42712803  routine_11012258   in order to  fit your treatment_1650240  plan_15823699  around your lifestyle_14875322 .

You should remember_2602069  that many_41607490  of the medicines_13698752  that are used_21147708  to treat_277958  HIV_113991390  can react_2709260  in unpredictable_41907470  ways_14873611  if you take_21145724  other_42140352  types_15767228  of medicines_13698752 .
These include_22607558  herbal_42977893  remedies_14028651  such as St John's Wort_17782417 , recreational_drugs_14019378 , such as cocaine_13029971  and overthecounter_41912000  (OTC) medicines_13698752 .
You should always_319576  check with your clinic_17944416  staff_18324833 , or your GP_19975301 , before taking_21145724  any_42344366  other_42140352  medicines_13698752 .
It is sometimes_322353  possible_41886604  to halt_22535439  the development_113291608  of HIV_113991390  in the first_41050981  72_42269606  hours_115028658  after infection_113324654 .
This is known_2588050  as  post  exposure_114351231  prophylaxis_11064961  (PEP).
PEP involves_22610758  taking_21145724  anti_41882018 HIV_113991390  medicines_13698752  for four_42263051  weeks_114970832 .
PEP is often_359780  used_21147708  when a person_17626  knows_2587430  that they have definitely_337805  been exposed_21025831  to the HIV_113991390  virus_11312417 .
For example_15861689 , if they were having_sex_21414190  with someone_17626  who they knew_2588050  had_264897  the HIV_113991390  virus_11312417 , and the condom_13057057  broke_2255298 , or they were accidentally_3213926  stabbed_21218987  with an HIV_113991390  infected_42190227  needle_13773495 .
However_328097 , PEP is not_324548  guaranteed_2880793  to work_22501264 , and the medicines_13698752  that are used_21153919  cause_21630835  some_41609861  unpleasant_41865078  side_effects_114120984 , such as nausea_114168673 , vomiting_1116068 , diarrhoea_114180580 , and headaches_15759473 .
If you are concerned_22652643  that you have been exposed_21025831  to the HIV_113991390  virus_11312417 , you should immediately_349076  contact_2734887  your local_42841627  Accident_17201255  and Emergency_17316426  Department_18004597 , or GUM (genitourinary_42966543  or sexual_42212218  health_113737741 ) clinic_17944416 .
Impetigo_114039147  can normally_3107782  be successfully_3121072  treated_277958  using_21153919  antibiotic_42716287  cream_13096495  (topical_41478327  antibiotics_12691801 ).
You should first_3103443  wash_235853  any_42344366  affected_476117  areas_12710247  of skin_15175953  with warm_42612325 , soapy_43108294  water_17828101  before applying_21351569  the cream_13096495 .
It is important_4688962  that you then wash_235853  your hands_15495293  immediately_349076  afterwards_361510 , or if available_4203394 , use_21147708  latex_114808816  gloves_13404471  when applying_21351569  the cream_13096495 .
The condition_113735349  should normally_3107782  respond_2709260  to treatment_1650240  within seven_42263356  days_114956162 .
However_328097 , if the condition_113735349  does not_324548  respond_2709260 , or the impetigo_114039147  is widespread_4569280  and severe_41567378 , antibiotic_42716287  tablets_13892329  (oral_41726148  antibiotics_12691801 ) will be prescribed_2738660 .
A seven_42263356  day_114956162  course_18262401  of oral antibiotics_12691801  is normally_3107782  recommended_2873642 .
It is important_4688962  that you/your child_19771320  finish_2479055  the course_18262401  of antibiotics_12691801  even_318086  if the symptoms_114108771  clear_up_22745640 .
Where possible_41886604 , the suspect_41986367  animal_115024  should be captured_21204101  and watched_22112175  for 5_42263136 10_42263664  days_114956162 .
If, after this time_114923492 , no_42345165  symptoms_114108771  of rabies_114081020  have been observed_22134693 , it can be assumed_2624797  that the animal_115024  is not_324548  rabid_42871664 .
The person_17626  who has been bitten_21433380  can stop_22655013  any_42344366  rabies_114081020  treatment_1650240  they may have been receiving_22189688 .
If the animal_115024  is killed_21312214  or dies_2354455 , its brain_15413129  can be examined_22111491  for the presence_113771566  of the rabies_114081020  virus_11312417 .
Diagnosis_1149750  in humans_12450463  is carried_out_21626161  by examination_1629633  of saliva_15350498 .
If the infected_42190227  person_17626  should develop_293465  severe_41567378  symptoms_114108771  and die_2354455 , a postmortem_1138815  or fluorescent_4426073  antibody_114829619  test_1779545  (FAT) on the brain_15413129  can be used_21147708  to confirm_2657823  rabies_114081020 .
If an animal_115024  that is possibly_3302787  infected_288912  with rabies_114081020  bites_21433380  you, you must be treated_277958  promptly_3106318 .
