In some_42343988 , rare_4513773  cases_17208756 , it can also_347757  be transmitted_22210942  through direct_4808017  contact_1122359  with someone_17626  who is_22579744  infected_42190227 .
This is_22579744  because the virus_11312417  will be_22579744  present_41793279  in the saliva_15350498  of an infected_42190227  person_17626  so contact_1122359 , such as kissing_21418987  may help_22711571  spread_21366367  the infection_113986195 .
Once_3182502  the polio_virus_11321314  enters_21998301  your body_15154650 , it begins_2341793  to multiply_254376  in you throat_15478544  and intestines_15465549 .
It then_3118752  travels_21818343  to your central_nervous_system_15412828  through your blood_15335196 .
In rare_4513773  cases_17208756 , as the virus_11312417  moves_21818343  along your nervous_system_15394688 , it may damage_2255490  your nerve_cells_15397886 .
People_17834515  infected_42190227  with the polio_virus_11321314  are_22579744  most_3112597  contagious 7_42263356 10_42263664  days_114956162  before, and after, their symptoms_114108771  appear_2417790 .
However_328097 , they can spread_21366367  the virus_11312417  for up to six_42263219  weeks_114970832  in their faeces_114658602 .
There are_22579744  more_than_3263710  two_hundred_42274562  different_42141357  viruses_11312417  that can cause_21630835  a cold_113957149 .
The most_3112597  common_4510922  belong_22713243  to one of two_42262856  groups_129714   the rhinoviruses_11322117  and coronaviruses.
The number_15061203  of different_42141357  viruses_11312417  that can cause_21630835  a cold_113957149  is_22579744  the reason_16649321  why it is_22579744  possible_41886604  to have_22088655  several_42344948  colds_113957149 , one after the other  each_42346315  one caused_21630835  by a different_42141357  virus_11312417 .
The viruses_11312417  that cause_21630835  a cold_113957149  attack_219756  the lining_13632952  of the nose_15528651  and throat_15478544 , making_21630835  these areas_15160192  become_2147020  inflamed_41223695 .
As they become_2147020  inflamed_41223695  they begin_2341793  producing_21737120  more_41611077  mucus_15349694 , resulting_22608883  in a runny nose and sneezing_114123857 .
Colds_113957149  can be spread_21367933  in several_4519472  ways_14873611 .
If you have_264628  a cold_113957149  and you sneeze_24819 , cough_25817  or speak_2932466 , tiny_41444120  droplets_113590979  of fluid_114743189  containing_22604187  the cold_113957149  virus_11312417  are launched_21501742  into the air_114645770 .
If these are breathed_in_25041  by someone_17626  else_42141506  then_3119164  they may become_2147020  infected_42190227 .
Colds_113957149  can also_347757  spread_21367933  through direct_4808017  and indirect_4808530  contact_1122359 .
If you have_264628  a cold_113957149  and you touch_21194934  your nose_15528651  or eyes_15247572  and then_3118752  touch_21194934  someone_17626  else_42141506 , you may pass the virus_11312417  on to them.
Alternatively_363479 , if you touch_21194934  an object_13122  such as a door_handle_13189712  or telephone_14349065 , the virus_11312417  may be transferred to the object_13122 .
If someone_17626  touches_21194934  the object_13122  a short_41494564  time_115069770  later_3156731  and then_3118752  touches_21194934  their mouth_15239404 , nose_15528651  or eyes_15247572 , they may become_2147020  infected_42190227 .
Although more than 200_42274562  viruses_11312417  can cause_21630835  a common_cold_113957149 , the rhinovirus_11322117  is_22579744  the most_3112597  common_41010117  culprit, and it's highly_390086  contagious_41351620 .
A cold_113957149  virus_11312417  enters_21998301  your body_15154650  through your mouth_15239404  or nose_15528651 , but it's likely_41463112  you also_347757  had a "hand" in your own_41831352  illness_113875408 .
The virus_11312417  can spread_21367933  through droplets_113590979  in the air_114645770  when someone_17626  who is_22579744  sick_42624970  coughs_25817 , sneezes_24819  or talks_2952735 .
But it also_347757  spreads_21367933  by hand_15495293 tohand_15495293  contact_1122359  with someone_17626  who has_264628  a cold_113957149  or by using_21147708  shared_22273977  objects_13122 , such as utensils_14462854 , towels_14406312 , toys_13919884  or telephones_14349065 .
Touch_21194934  your eyes_15247572 , nose_15528651  or mouth_15239404  after such contact_1122359  or exposure, and you're likely_41463112  to "catch_287150 " a cold_113957149 .
The common_cold_113957149  is spread_21366367  mostly_3156864  by hand_15495293 tohand_15495293  contact_1122359 .
For_example_3160083 , a person_17626  with a cold_113957149  blows_234439  or touches_21194934  his or her nose_15528651  and then_3118752  touches_21194934  someone_17626  else_42141506  who then_3119164  becomes_2147020  infected_42190227  with the virus_11312417 .
Additionally_346444 , the cold_113957149  virus_11312417  can live_22593061  on objects_13122  such as pens_13863109 , books_12842263 , and coffee_cups_13032612  for several_42344948  hours_115028658  and can be acquired_22190280  from such objects_13122 .
While common_sense_15545126  would suggest_2921281  that coughing_1116903  and sneezing_114123857  spread_21366367  the common_cold_113957149 , these are_22579744  actually_3150716  very_332750  poor_42415934  mechanisms_195744  for spreading_21366367  a cold_113957149 .
Pulmonary_tuberculosis_113955712  (which affects_219468  your lungs_15322893 ) is caught_287150  from an infectious_42191146  person_17626  by breathing_in_25041  tubercle_bacilli_11360172  germs_11367133  when they cough_25817  or sneeze_24819 .
However_328097 , tuberculosis_113955063  is_22579744  not_324548  easy_4787042  to catch_287150 , and you need to be_22579744  in close contact with an infectious_42191146  person_17626  for a prolonged_41491533  period_of_time_114914858  to be_22579744  at risk.
The TB_113955063  germ_11367133  has_22182934  a thick_42491250  capsule_15253532 , and can survive_22593061  dry_42635714  and usually_3107782  hostile_41291356  conditions (although it is killed_21312214  by UV_light_111355733 , for_example_3160083 , sunlight_111319894 ).
In countries_18426193  where unpasteurised_43235009  milk_17737974  is drunk_21158929 , TB_113955063  may be transmitted_22210942  in infected_42190227  milk_17737974  from cows_12380237  with bovine tuberculosis.
Typhoid_113956064  bacteria_11332092  are released_2103834  in the urine_114660064  and stools_114658602  of infected_42190227  people_17834515 .
If an infected_42190227  person_17626  does not_324548  wash_235853  their hands_15495293  properly_3197726  before handling_21199418  food_120429 , the disease_113883821  may be spread_21366367  to anyone who eats_21157345  the food_120429 .
Once_3182502  ingested_21145724  (taken_21145724  into your body_15154650 ), the bacteria_11332092  multiply_254376  in your blood_stream_15337236 , causing_21630835  the first_41050981  signs_114110919  of disease_113883821  in the form of fever_114174023 .
The bacterium_11332092  is then_3118752  absorbed_21526192  into your digestive_tract_15463441 , bone_marrow_15222547 , liver_15320883  and bile_ducts_15322194 .
In the second_42278352  stage_115089620  of the infection_113986195 , the bacterium_11332092  enters_21998301  the small_intestine_15465928  causing_21630835  violent_42594668  diarrhoea_114180580  symptoms_114108771  to begin.
The typhoid_113956064  bacterium_11332092  can survive_22594822  refrigeration_113374325 , freezing_113311138  and drying_2215474  so ensuring_2881284  high_41257379  standards_15849869  of food_120429  hygiene_114302461  and personal_41829957  hygiene_114302461  is_22579744  paramount.
Water_supplies_14508152  are_22579744  often_335856  infected_42190227  and even_317488  ice_114718531  can transmit_22210942  the disease_113883821 .
Shellfish_11920999  may be contaminated_2487588  by sewage_114661233  containing_22604187  infected_42190227  stools_114658602  and in the past_114922178 , contaminated_41977521  tinned_41113543  meat_17544879  products_13707459  have caused_21630835  typhoid_113956064  epidemics_17333958  in Britain_18733354 .
Someone_17626  who has_264628  typhoid_fever_113956064  is_22579744  most_3112597  contagious during the first_41050981  week_114970832  of the illness_113875408 .
The patient_110250423  should therefore_342866  be isolated_2489151  during this time_17209466 , if possible_41886604 .
As well as a person_17626  with the disease_113883821  being_22579744  infectious_42191146 , typhoid_113956064  can also_347757  be caught_287150  from a carrier_19751479 .
A carrier_19751479  is_22579744  someone_17626  who still_332017  has_22182934  typhoid_113956064  bacteria_11332092  in their system_15157385  after they have recovered_291852  from the disease_113883821 .
Carriers_19751479  do not_324548  show_22117319  symptoms_114108771  of the disease_113883821  but can spread_21366367  it via their stools_114658602 .
Approximately_37040  5_42263136 % of people_17834515  carry_22674836  the bacteria_11332092  for a year_115004692  or more_41612299 .
It is_22579744  therefore_342866  vital_4942587  that a carrier_19751479  of typhoid_113956064  does not_324548  have_22182934  an occupation_1576963  that involves_22610758  handling_21199418  food_120429 .
Treatment_1650240  is_22579744  available_4203394  for carriers_19751479  of typhoid_113956064 .
The disease_113883821  can be eradicated_21647134  in 4_42263051 6_42263219  weeks_114970832  using_21147708  antibiotic_42716287  treatment_1650240 .
The exact_4952885  origin_18389765  of HIV_11320298  remains_2115825  unknown_41427641 , but most_41613064  scientists_110402286  agree_2796868  that a form_15766180  of the virus_11312417 , known_as_42511488  SIVcpz (Simian Immunodeficiency Virus from chimps_12459245 ), was_22579744 , and still_332017  is_22579744 , present_41793279  in chimpanzees_12459245  living_22624510  in parts_18509674  of Africa_19057648 .
One_42262724  theory_15913225  is_22579744  that the virus_11312417  spread_21367933  to humans_12450463  that were hunting_21133038  the chimps_12459245 , possibly_3301838  because they came_2536727  into close_3411998  contact_1122359  with the infected_42190227  chimpanzee_12459245  blood_15335196 .
It is thought_2681247  that for many_41607490  years_115043767  the human_41306633  form_15766180  of the HIV_11320298  virus_11312417  was limited to a remote_421768  part_18509674  of Africa_19057648 .
However_328097 , when new_42141686  transport links opened_up_2534708  that part_18509674  of Africa_19057648 , the virus_11312417  spread_21367933  to other_42140352  parts_18509674  of Africa_19057648 , before slowly_3162675  spreading_21367933  across the world_19138104 .
The HIV_11320298  virus_11312417  breaks_down_2635816  the genetic_code_18342226  of cells_16300  used_21147708  by our immune_system_15393243 , particularly_384750  the cells_16300  known_as_42511488  CD4_cells_15384719 , and then_3118752  uses_21147708  the raw_4439830  genetic_42820466  material_114387488  to make_21639033  copies_13073222  of itself.
The body_15154650  can make_21639033  more_41612299  CD4_cells_15384719 , but eventually_348463  the HIV_11320298  virus_11312417  will reduce_2424760  the numbers_15061203  of CD4_cells_15384719  to such an extent_113755035  that the 
immune_system_15393243  will stop working_21512822 .
The HIV_11320298  virus_11312417  can be spread_21367933  through the exchange_11151051  of bodily_fluids_15332817 , such as semen_15339588  or blood_15335196 .
Therefore_342866  the condition can be spread_21366367  through sexual_intercourse_1833456 , including_22607558  oral_42856828 , and anal_42704663 , sex_1832187 .
People_17834515  who inject_21188126  illegal_41453383  drugs_13213810 , and share_22273977  needles_13773495 , are also_347757  at risk from getting_286898  the HIV_11320298  virus_11312417 .
The condition can also be spread_21366367  from a mother_110178093  to her unborn_41796323  child_19771320 .
However_328097 , medicines_13698752  can now_348812  be used_21147708  to prevent_22428989  this from happening_2336141 .
HIV_113991390  can be spread through blood_transfusions_1320457 .
However_328097 , since 1985 , in the UK_18733354  it has been_22579744  the policy_15826639  to screen_22508889  all_42345966  donated_41162562  blood_15335196  for HIV_11320298 .
Since the policy_15826639  was introduced_21604304 , no_42345165  one_15795834  in the UK_18733354  has caught_287150  HIV_113991390  from a blood_transfusion_1320457 .
Screening_1638497  policies_15826639  in the developing_41350884  world_19344389  may not_324548  be_22579744  as_322606  rigorous_4748132  as they are_22579744  in countries_18426193  such as the UK_18733354 , so there is_22579744  a possible_41886604  risk_114349152  of developing_293465  HIV_113991390  if you receive_22189688  a 
blood_transfusion_1320457  in certain_4737316  parts_18509674  of the world_19138104 .
Impetigo_114039147  is caused_21630835  by bacteria_11332092 , specifically_341621  two_42262856  types_15767228  of bacteria_11332092  known_as_42511488  
staphylococcus aureus and staphylococcus pyogenes.
Once_3182502  a person_17626  has become_2147020  infected_42190227  it is_22579744  very_332750  easy_4787042  for them to spread_21366367  the infection_113986195  to other_42140352  people_17834515  through close_4468023  physical_contact_1122359  or through sharing_22273977  towels_14406312  or flannels_14500065 .
Impetigo_114039147  does not_324548  cause_21630835  any_42344366  symptoms_114108771  until four_42263051  to ten_42263664  days_114956162  after the initial_41052110  exposure to the bacteria_11332092 , so it is_22579744  easy_4787042  for people_17834515  to spread_21366367  the condition as they do not_324548  realise_2720287  they are_22579744  infected_42190227 .
It is thought_2624298  that the condition is_22579744  more_3100048  common_41010117  in children_19771320  because their immune_system_15393243  has not_324548  yet_328508  fully_310491  developed_2248652 .
Rabies_114081020  can be transferred to a human_12449786  from an infected_42190227  animal_115024 , usually_3107782  a dog_12064081 , via a bite_1826758  or a lick_1147850  to broken_4311599  skin or the eyeball_15252366 .
Domestic_42470277  dogs_12064081  and cats_12100898  can pick up the infection_113324654  if exposed_22092494  to wild_42470576  animals_115024  with the disease_113883821  such as foxes_12097711 , wolves_12093478 , jackals_12094474 , skunks_12423366 , mongooses_12116600 , raccoons_12485407  and bats_12118250 .
The virus_11312417  remains_22703136  for a variable_42587786  period_114914858  at the site_18502657  of the bite_114096558  then_3118752  enters_21998301  the body_15154650  and multiplies_254376  in the muscle_cells_15391623  near the bite_114096558  wound_114107962 .
The virus_11312417  then_3118752  enters_21998301  the nerve_endings_15401315  and travels_21818343  to the spinal_cord_15435093  and the brain_15413129 .
Once_3182502  in the central_nervous_system_15412828 , the virus_11312417  spreads_21367933  to the salivary_glands_15464160 , lungs_15322893 , kidneys_15268496  and other_42140352  organs_15234428 .
The incubation_period_115093872  (the time_115069770  between the bite_1826758  and the start_115064913  of the symptoms_114108771 ) varies_22636971  with the distance_15025048  of the bite_114096558  from the head_15469706 , but is_22579744  usually_3107782  two_42262856  to three_42262966  months_115007086 .
Severe_41567378  bites_114096558  on the head_15469706 , face_15531141  or neck_15477621  may result_22608883  in rabies_114081020  in as_322606  short_41494564  a period_114914858  as nine_42263529  days_114956162 .
Bites_114096558  further_330352  from the head_15469706  are followed by a much_359483  longer_41490468  incubation_period_115093872 , perhaps_3301838  as_322606  long_41490468  as several_42344948  months_115007086 .
The incubation_period_115093872  also_347757  varies_22636971  with different_42141357  strains_18000941  of the virus_11312417 , but the average_41652635  time_115069770  between bite_1826758  and onset_17225764  is_22579744  four_42263051  to eight_42263441  weeks_114970832 .
Approximately_37040  50_42267528 % of infected_42190227  bites_114096558  lead_22610448  to the disease_113883821 .
Children_19771320  may be_22579744  at a greater_41447007  risk from infection_113324654 , as they are_22579744  shorter_41488508  in height_15076538  and their upper_41252617  body_15154650  is_22579744  closer_4470563  to the ground_19200358 .
They should be discouraged_2898802  from petting_21413685  unknown_41427641  animals_115024  whilst abroad.
A germ_11367133  called_42511627  corynebacterium_diphtheriae_11349926  causes_21630835  diphtheria_113935396 , which infects_287875  the throat_15478544  and sometimes_322353  the skin_15175953 .
Diphtheria_113935396  is_22579744  very_332750  contagious_41351620  and can be passed from person_17626  to person_17626  through the tiny_41444120  droplets_113590979  in sneezes_114123857  and coughs_114167903 .
It can be spread_21367933  by touching_21194934  anything_12819  that an infected_42190227  person_17626  has used_21147708  eg_3160083  tissue_114877073 , cup_13115437  or by close_4468023 , facetoface_344253  contact_1122359 .
The bacteria_11332092  will then_3118752  increase_2153864  and multiply_254376  on or near the moist_42632460  parts of the mouth_15239404  and throat_15478544 , where they cause_21630835  inflammation_114145268 .
A person_17626  who has_264628  the disease_113883821  may be_22579744  infectious_42191146  between two_42262856  and four_42263051  weeks_114970832  even_317488  if they don't have_22182934  any_42344366  symptoms_114108771  but can be_22579744  a carrier_19751479  of the bacteria_11332092  for a longer_41490468  time_115069770 .
Whooping_cough_113956274  is caused_21630835  by an infection_113986195  of the lining_13632952  of the breathing_1819106  airways_15441543 .
The infection_113986195  causes_21630835  inflammation_114145268  and swelling_114124199  of these airways_15441543  and makes_2761805  them produce_21737120  too_347638  much_41609427  mucus_15349694 .
The bacterium_11332092  that causes_21630835  whooping_cough_113956274  is called_21018451  bordetella pertussis.
It is carried in droplets_113590979  of moisture_114342749  in the air_114645770 .
When a child_19771320  with the disease_113883821  coughs_25817  or sneezes_24819 , they send_out_21424763  hundreds_113569316  of infected_42190227  water_17828101  droplets_113590979  into the air_114645770 .
This is_22579744  why whooping_cough_113956274  is_22579744  so_3147781  infectious_42191146 .
Older_41703749  children_19771320  are usually_3107782  not_324548  seriously_315978  affected_219468  by whooping_cough_113956274 , but they can spread_21366367  the infection_113986195  to younger_41706638  babies_19682781 .
Chikungunya is_22579744  a viral_42965033  disease_113883821  transmitted_22210942  through the agency_1169254  of mosquitoes_12178886 .
The responsible_4347714  virus_11312417  is_22579744  the alphavirus_11316185 , which is carried by the aedes_aegypti_12179538  breed of mosquito_12178886 .
Hence_342866 , after malaria_113891291 , filaria and dengue_113941460 , chikungunya has become_2147020  one_42262724  more reason_19047424  to exterminate_21315780  mosquitoes_12178886 .
The prime_41053073  method_15590135  of spread_1364065  of chikungunya is through stagnated_22700508  water_19092958 .
The aedes_aegypti_12179538  mosquito_12178886  lays_21532053  its eggs_11442949  only_38625  in stagnated_22700508  water_19092958 .
This explains_2929780  why there is_22579744  a widespread_41145472  outbreak_17333698  of chikungunya in India_18772979  currently_348605 , which has just_333984  recovered from heavy_41237334  floods_111289656  in July_115012957 August_115013245 .
Ayurveda treats_2643149  chikungunya as a vata dosha disorder_113866201 .
Vata is_22579744  the air_114645770  element_15794751  of our body_15154650 , which is represented_22673466  by the air_114645770  that we breathe_21740 , the dissolved_2441682  gases_114288396  in our blood_15335196 , etc._3104379 .
