She was_22579744  in an advanced_4857679  stage_115089620  of delivery_17220424  and had developed_293465  complications_113887502  that the untrained_41981245  village_18551779  Dai (traditional_4642160  midwife_110160953 ) could not_324548  handle_22412701 .
Madhu's condition_113735349  turned_2123553  critical_4683112  but her family_17968033  was_22579744  reluctant_42650736  to take_21981555  her to the hospital_13501793 .
Kamala Khilo, a Self_Help_1790579  Group_129714  member_110153551  of the same_42139473  village_18551779  came to Madhu's rescue_191190  and took_21981555  her to the district_18433448  hospital_13501793 , about_37040  70_42269419  kms_113479608  from the village_18551779 .
Still_328097  not_324548  convinced_4359664 , Madhu's husband_110041644  was_22579744  very_332750  annoyed_41869523  and threatened_2862367  Kamala that if anything_12819  should happen_2336141  to Madhu or the child_19771976  then he would kill_21312214  her. 
Kamala silently_3113078  waited_22612588  for the doctor_19872125  to come_out_2419402  of  the  operation theatre_3807368 .
To her great_41738946  relief_17391167 , when he finally_348463  emerged_2419671  the doctor_19872125  announced_2964658  that the mother_110178093  and child_19771976  were_22579744  both fine_42152179 .
The doctor_19872125  also_347757  thanked_2883009  Kamala for bringing_22059102  Madhu to the hospital_13501793  in_time_3169100 , as otherwise, it would have been_22579744  difficult_4782675  to save_22526596  her life_110107487 .
Suka Ram, Madhu's husband_110041644  apologized_2883617  to Kamala and handed_over_22271776  his newborn_41709011  son_110464570  to her saying_2999158  that the baby_19682781  belonged_22280009  to her as it was_22579744  only_38625  because of her that the child_19771976  and mother_110178093  survived_22594822 .
While describing_2977345  this incident_17207379 , a quiet_41915384  joy_17424946  gleamed_22140916  on Kamala's face_15531141 .
Kamala Khilo is_22579744  one among six_42263219  women_110626312  of Nuaguda village_18551779  who has received_22189688  the Mother_110178093  and Child_19771976  Protection_1805831  Care_1648004  training_1881267  organised_21636679  by the ANKUR initiative_1235414  of UNICEF_18185975 .
This training_1881267  has been imparted_2919094  to the women_110626312  from the 60_42268462  selfhelp_1790579  groups_129714  of 67_42269127  villages_18551779  in Potangi block.
Under the four_42263051 day_114956162  training_1881267  programme_15823699 , the SHG members_110153551  were taught_2820277  about pre and post natal_42852373  care_1648004  for the mother_110178093  and care_1648004  of the newborn_infant_110198563  from 0_42262518  to 6_42263219  months_115007086  of age_114946104 .
They were also_347757  trained_2595702  in care_1648004  of children_19771320  from 0_42262518  to 3_42262966  years_115004692 .
The fourth_42278631  day_114956162  of training_1881267  was_22579744  about preschool_18162755  education_1870909 , girls_19979060 ' education_1870909 , handling_22412701  dropout_19847463  children_19771320 , water_17828101  and sanitation_114302847 .
Since maternal_41797695  mortality_115076439  and infant_mortality_rates_115084906  are_22579744  pretty_318620  high_41257379  in Koraput, this kind_15766180  of initiative_1235414  definitely_337805  helps_22711571  in bringing_about_21737491  a change_113675329  in the 
long term.
The tribal_43155222  community_18110535  needs_22602586  to be_22579744  aware_4210420  of the fact_15744635  that to some_42343988  extent_113755035  their ignorance_15912064  about mother_110178093  and child_19771320  care_1648004  is_22579744  also_347757  responsible_for_4347714  the high_41257379  MMR and IMR in the district_18433448 .
Under this training_1881267  programme_15823699  we have not_only_325615  given_22294885  them training_1881267  on mother_110178093  and child_19771320  care_1648004  but also_347757  taught_2820277  them to monitor_22143792  the process_11009596  on their own and to spread_21366367  awareness_15605790  among others in the village_18551779 .
Kamala Khilo, who saved_22526596  the life_110107487  of Madhu and her child_19771976  herself had been_22579744  a victim_110591377  of  such  ignorance_15912064 .
She lost_21777911  her first_41050981  child_19771976  because the untrained_41981245  Dai cut_21539493  the child_19771976  umbilical_cord_15451789  just_3159561  after his birth_17220104  with a sharp_4838853  piece_13888000  of tile_114876679 .
It was_22579744  my first_41050981  child_19771976  and I was_22579744  totally_38032  unaware_4211910  of newborn_110198563  care_1648004 .
We used_22347413  to think_2681247  that immunization_1816905  is_22579744  harmful_41669483  for newborns_110198563  so we used_22347413  to hide_22125100  our children_19771976  when the doctors_19872125  came_21987643  to our village_18551779 .
Most of our children_19771976  were_22579744  not_324548  immunized_42444336  in those days_114924376 ; now_348812  UNICEF_18185975  and its training_1881267  have opened our eyes. 
Today_348812  in this village_18551779  all_42345966  the children_19771976  have been_22579744  immunized_42444336 . 
Prior_4140635  to the training_1881267 , there were_22579744  just_3247602  no_42345165  institutional_42835241  deliveries_140898 , although the local_42841627  PHC (Primary Health Centre) is_22629830  just_34711  one_42262724  kilometre_113479608  away_3236620 .
Now_348812  all_42345966  four_42263051  pregnant_4193734  women_110626312  have had_256206  their babies_19682781  in the hospital_13501793  and no_42345165  woman_110626312  wants_21808093  to deliver_256206  at home_18440931  anymore_332319 .
Maliguda is_22579744  yet_317682  another_42141203  village_18551779  emulating_22649906  the Nuaguda example_15850315 .
The SHG members_110153551  of Maliguda have also_347757  received_22189688  the training_1881267  and are implementing_22385399  the regimen_15834716  in their village_18551779 .
Here_3109485  most of our pregnant_4193734  women_110626312  are following_2148213  the precautions_1811103  except a few who can't take rest_11049843  during this period_114914858  due_to_4192257  their family_17968033  problems_114219078 .
Otherwise all_42345966  the 21_42264727  children_19771320  in our village_18551779  are_22579744  immunized_42444336  by now and four_42263051  women_110626312  out of six_42263219  had institutional_42835241  delivery_140898 .
The SHG members_110153551  visit_22463694  each_42346315  and every_42346474  household_17968033  and motivate_21635233  pregnant_4193734  women_110626312  to take_care_22525309  of themselves as well as make_2118050  them aware_4210420  of the immunization_1816905  necessary_41637954  for the children_19771320 .
They are also_347757  informing_2822821  them about sanitation_114302847  and mother_110178093  / child_19771976  care_1648004 .
Although the Government_17941270  has promised_2874706  to provide_21171470  
health_114256157  services_1579749  to each_42346315  and every_42346474  village_18551779  of the state_18533584 , but due_to_4192257  lack_114257672  of proper_41945146  communication_113611748  systems_18320953  many_41607490  tribal_43155222  villages_18551779  are_22579744  still_328097  inaccessible_421503 .
