But when the vata dosha is vitiated_2472923 , then disease_113883821  conditions_113735349  may set_in_22584333 .
Chikungunya is one of such diseases_113883821 , which are caused_21630835  due_to_4192257  an alleviation_1351073  of the vata dosha.
The virus_11312417  is easily_3149063  passed_22031827  from person_17626  to person_17626  through the air_18532563  by droplets_113590979  and small_41443454  particles_114391935  excreted_272257  when infected_42190227  individuals_17626  cough_25817  or sneeze_24819 .
The influenza_113934383  virus_11312417  enters_21998301  the body_15154650  through the nose_15528651  or throat_15478544 .
It then takes_22246711  between one_42262724  and four_42263051  days_114956162  for the person_17626  to develop_293465  symptoms_114108771 .
Someone_17626  suffering_264897  from influenza_113934383  can be infectious_42191146  from the day_114956162  before they develop_293465  symptoms_114108771  until seven_42263356  days_114956162  afterwards_361510 .
Disease_113883821  spreads_21367933  very_332750  quickly_3106318  among the population_18066746  especially_384750  in crowded_4588826  circumstances_114280538 .
Cold_41299300  and dry_42635714  weather_111358426  enables_2507708  the virus_11312417  to survive_22593061  longer_3394891  outside_18493436  the body_15154650  than in other_42140352  conditions_113735349  and, as a consequence_111246064 , seasonal_41547680  epidemics_17333958  in temperate_42483861  areas_18379933  appear_2420771  in winter_115038594 .
Influenza_113934383  viruses_11312417  A and B cause_21630835  the classic_42372965  flu_113934383 .
Type A is usually_3107782  responsible_4347714  for the outbreaks_17333698  that occur_2336141  annually_382264 .
These viruses_11312417  are constantly_320727  changing_2108238 , producing_21737120  what are called_42511488    subtypes   or strains_18000941  that are different_42135760  from the original_41052604  virus_11312417  but retain_22675615  some of its characteristics_15776742 .
Strains_18000941  of influenza_113934383  virus_11312417  that cause_21630835  the flu_113934383  may differ_22640699  from year_115004692  to year_115004692 .
Infective_42191146  conjunctivitis_114150161  occurs_2336141  when the conjunctiva_15251462  (the thin_42493022  layer_13609573  of cells_16300  covering_22127374  the white_4415382  of your eye_15247572  and the inner_4989774  surface_18539566  of your eyelids_15250189 ) becomes_2147020  inflamed_41223695  as a result_111246064  of an infection_113324654 .
There are a variety_18284231  of factors_17227543  which can cause_21630835  an infection_113324654  to develop_293465  in your eye_15247572 .
There are no_325058  particular_41146622  signs_16557644  or symptoms_114108771  that will allow_22697111  your GP_19975301  to distinguish_2642357  between a bacterial_42918824  infection_113324654  and a viral_42965033  infection_113324654 .
Both_42344813  types_15767228  of conjunctivitis_114150161  will normally_3107782  heal_298189  by themselves.
If your conjunctivitis_114150161  is caused_21630835  by a sexually_3137288  transmitted_22210942  infection_113324654  (STI), such as chlamydia_113987225 , it will usually_3107782  result_22610151  in your conjunctivitis_114150161  lasting_22678881  for several_42344948  months_115007086 , rather than weeks_114970832 .
If your condition_113735349  is persistent_41820878 , you will have an eye_15247572  swab_14315994  to determine_2911004  the cause_17127  of the infection_113324654  (see_22109658  'diagnosis_1149750 ' section_15793444 ).
If your infective_42191146  conjunctivitis_114150161  is caused_21630835  by an STI, you will have to undergo_22088655  screening_22508889  and treatment_1650240  for the infection_113324654 .
Newborn_41709011  babies_19682781  can develop_293465  conjunctivitis_114150161  if the mother_110178093  has Chlamydia_113987225  because the infection_113324654  is often_335856  passed_22200928  to the baby_19682781  during birth_17220104 .
You are more_3100048  likely_3139422  to develop_293465  infective_42191146  conjunctivitis_114150161  if you have been in close_4468023  contact_114227848  with someone_17626  who is already_332511  infected_42190227 .
It is therefore_3296032  very_332750  important_41323836  that you make_sure_22570655  that you wash_235853  your hands_15495293  thoroughly_357777  after coming_2536727  into contact_114227848  with someone_17626  who has the condition_114353545 .
Scabies_113991973  is caused_21630835  by the human_12449786  parasite_11367329  known_as_42511488  sarcoptes_11762620  scabiei.
An infestation_114260883  starts_21846810  when a female_41531387  mite_11760838  burrows_22023763  into your skin_15175953 .
The mite_11760838  can burrow_22023763  into your skin_15175953  within 30_42265602  minutes_115035576 .
Male_41530284  mites_11760838  move_21818343  between different_42141357  burrow_19097676  sites_18502657  looking_22133894  to mate_21416629  with an unfertilised_41043036  female_41531387 .
Once_3182502  mating_1835254  has taken_place_2336141 , the male_41530284  mite_11760838  dies_2354455  and the female_41531387  mite_11760838  begins_2341793  to lay_21532053  eggs_11442949 , which will hatch_262371  in approximately_37040  3_42262966 4_42263051  days_114956162 .
The eggs_11442949  take_22246711  10_42263664 15_42264143  days_114956162  to grow_2246814  into adult_41541985  males_11304946 , or females_11304606 .
Without effective_4872674  treatment_1650240  this life_cycle_111308334  can continue_22659138  indefinitely_3205377 .
Scabies_113991973  mites_11760838  are resistant_42517596  to soap_14203074  and hot_41295235  water_17828101 , and they cannot be scrubbed_21239632  out_3234935  of the skin_15175953 .
The exact_4663721  cause_17226331  of the intense_41564074  itchiness_15653259  that is associated_2705069  with scabies_113991973  is unknown_41427641 , but most_41613064  experts_19481423  believe_2675183  that the itchiness_15653259  is caused_21630835  by the immune_system_15393243  reacting_2709260  to the mites_11760838 , and their saliva_15350498 , eggs_11442949 , and faeces_114658602 .
Scabies_113991973  mites_11760838  cannot fly_21922384 , or jump_21945853 , so they can only_34711  move from one human_body_15155456  to another_42141203  if two_42262856  people_17834515  have direct_4808017  and prolonged_41491533  physical_contact_1122359 .
Transmission_17259850  by brief_41495204  and limited_4555744  physical_contact_1122359 , such as a handshake_16543846 , or a hug_1413592 , is unlikely_41464076 .
Scabies_113991973  mites_11760838  can survive_22593061  outside_18493436  the human_body_15155456  for between 24_42265016 36_42266179  hours_115028658 , so it is possible_41886604  to become_2147020  infested_22629381  by coming into contact_114227848  with contaminated_42190696  clothes_12702992 , or bed_linen_12794163 .
However_329510 , this is a far_3102030  less_3100234  common_41010117  way_1169254  of acquiring_293465  the condition_113735349 .
Scabies_113991973  infestations_114260883  can quickly_3106318  spread_21366367  because people_17834515  are usually_3107782  unaware_4211910  that they have the condition_113735349  until 2_42262856 6_42263219  weeks_114970832  after the initial_41052110  infection_113324654  has taken_place_2336141 .
In confined_4587527  environments_113748560 , such as schools_18162936 , or nursing_homes_13489779 , where people_17834515  are in close_4470563  proximity_15026714  to one another, there is an increased_4918827  risk_15033656  of catching_175912  scabies_113991973 .
People_17834515  often_335856  regard_2682517  scabies_113991973  as a condition_113735349  that results_22608883  from poor_41173827  personal_41842006  hygiene_114302461  and living_43233440  conditions_113735349 , but there is no_42345165  evidence_16554796  that this is the case_17208756 .
Scabies_113991973  can affect_219468  people_17834515  from all_42345966  walks_of_life_1578823 .
Any_42344366  bacteria_11332092  or virus_11312417  has the potential_114289972  to cause_21630835  meningitis_113949477 .
Bacterial_42918824  meningitis_113949477  is caused_21630835  by several_42344948  different_42135760  types_15767228  of germs_11367133  which live_22624510  naturally_3141379  at the back_14014136  of the nose_15528651  and throat_15478544  and can be spread_21366367  by close_4470563  prolonged_41491533  contact_114227848 , coughing_1116903 , sneezing_114123857  and kissing_1841901 .
In the UK_18733354  the most_3112597  common_41010117  cause_16649733  of bacterial_42918824  meningitis_113949477  is infection_113324654  with the meningococcal or pneumococcal_42924262  bacteria_11332092 , but Hib, TB_113955063 , E._Coli_11351564 , and Group B streptococcal_43220543  bacteria_11332092  can also_347757  cause_21630835  meningitis_113949477 .
Viral_42965033  meningitis_113949477  may be caused_21630835  by viruses_11312417  such as coxsackie, herpes_simplex_11322488 , mumps_113949826 , the varicella_zoster_virus_11323594  of chickenpox_113944651  and shingles_113944505 , poliovirus_11321314 , echoviruses_11321913  (including_22607558  enteroviruses_11321495 ).
Germs_11367133  can be spread_21366367  through coughing_1116903 , sneezing_114123857 , poor_41173827  hygiene_114302461  or sewage_114661233  polluted_41977521  water_17828101 .
Meningitis_113949477  can also_347757  be a feature_15776742  of other_42140352  diseases_113883821 , including_22607558  Lyme_disease_114074861 , Leptospirosis_114082718 , Typhus_113952710 , Tuberculosis_113955063  and other_42140352  infections_113324654 .
To make a preliminary_4916846  diagnosis_1149750  of malaria_113891291 , your GP_19975301  will ask_2888440  you about your symptoms_114108771  and look_22133894  at your travel_1291908  history_114922667 .
It is important_41323836  that you tell_2942955  your GP_19975301  about where you have travelled_21828364  to in the last_41792257  12_42263833  months_115010203 , including_22607558  places_18543623  where you only_34711  made a brief_41495204  stop_over_11042106 .
You can be at risk of malaria if you are a resident of, or travel to, or from, any country where malaria is present.
After the preliminary_4916846  diagnosis_1149750 , you will have a blood_15335196  sample_15748975  taken   in order to   confirm_2657823  the condition_113735349 .
A small_41443454  amount_132028  of blood_15335196  is taken and mixed_21449281  with a special_42354665  solution_114395621  before being analysed_2727870  under a microscope_13719225 .
This test_1779545  will be able_41740  to confirm_2657823  the presence_113771566  of malaria_113891291 , and will also_347757  indicate_2911970  to your GP_19975301  what type_15767228  of parasite_11367329  is causing_21630835  your condition_113735349 .
Malaria_113891291  can be a potentially_3302787  fatal_41033404  condition_113735349 , but with a prompt_41018447  diagnosis_1149750  and treatment_1650240 , many_41607490  people_17834515  make a full_4549578  recovery_113279505 .
If you have been diagnosed_2637804  with malaria_113891291 , your treatment_1650240  will start_2344775  as soon as possible_41886604 .
Malaria_113891291  is normally_3107782  treated_277958  using_21147708  antimalarial_12696626  medicines_13698752 .
There are a variety_18284231  of these medicines_13698752  available_4203394 .
The type_15767228  of medicine_13698752  you receive_22189688  may vary_2120850  if you are being treated_277958  elsewhere_385529  in the world_19138104 .
Due_to_4192257  an increased_4918827  level_15034128  of resistance_114334507  to the malaria_parasite_11407026 , in some_41608450  countries_18426193  particular_41146622  medicines_13698752  have been rendered_2118409  almost_373379  completely_38032  useless_42580764 .
If you have_264897  a mild_41563266  case_17208756  of malaria_113891291 , you may be prescribed_2738660  medication_13698752  that you can take_21145724  at home_18440931 .
If your malaria_113891291  is more_3100048  severe_41567378 , you may have to be admitted_22478434  to hospital_17944757 .
If you are unable_42098  to take_21145724  your medication_13698752  orally_3157867 , you may have to have your antimalarial_12696626  medicine_13698752  administered_280270  intravenously_3383613  (through a vein_15353017  in your arm_15494473 ).
If you have taken_21145724  an antimalarial_drug_12696626  as a form_15766180  of prevention_11063016  before visiting_21826333  a tropical_42526019  country_18426193 , and later_361510  go_on_21974178  to still contract_286898  the condition_113735349 , you will have to be prescribed_2738660  a different_42141045  type_15767228  of medicine_13698752  in order for your treatment_1650240  to be effective_4872674 .
If the first_41050981  antimalarial_12696626  medicine_13698752  that you are prescribed_2738660  fails_22504178  to improve_2202884  your symptoms_114108771 , you may have to try_22507405  a variety_18284231  of other_42140352  medicines_13698752  as part_113628130  of your treatment_1650240 .
Treatment_1650240  for malaria_113891291  can leave_22705088  you feeling_22086634  very_332750  weak_42402394  and tired_42513941  for several_42344948  weeks_114970832  afterwards_361510 .
If you are pregnant_4193734 , some of the medicines_13698752  that are usually_3107782  used_21153919  to treat_277958  malaria_113891291  are unsuitable_41062077  because they may cause_21630835  side_effects_114120984  for both_42344813  you and your child_19771320 .
Chloroquine_12992695  and quinine_13989813  are the medicines_13698752  that are safe_42128580  to use_21153919  during pregnancy_113859987 .
These can be used_21153919  at any stage_115089620  of your pregnancy_113859987  without harm_17319791  to you, or your baby_19682781 .
