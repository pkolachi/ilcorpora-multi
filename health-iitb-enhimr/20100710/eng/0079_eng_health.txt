Instead of cutting out bottles_12849407  all_at_once_3153163 , you can gradually_3108993  eliminate_22603908  them from the feeding_11043454  schedule_16409244 , starting_2341793  with mealtime_114966596 .

If you are breastfeeding_21175192 , only_34711  offer_22275070  milk_17737974  in a cup_13115437  and avoid_22439650  the bottle_12849407  habit_1410053  altogether_38032 .
Some_42343988  kids_19771320  don't like_21760206  cow_12381266  milk_17737974  at_first_3103901  because it's different_42135760  from the breast_15485384  milk_15334383  or formula_17738920  they're used_to_426437 .
If that's the case_15744982 , it's OK_353392  to mix_2181426  whole_milk_17740657  with formula_17738920  or breast_15485384  milk_15334383  and gradually_3108993  adjust_2292692  the mixture_17775793  so that it eventually_347864  becomes_2147020  100_42272367 % cow_12381266  milk_17737974 .
Although you can now start_2341793  to offer_22275070  some of the foods_120429  you've been withholding_22193115  (milk_17737974 , citrus_fruits_17641366 , whole_4541319  eggs_17734736 ), watch_22132134  for allergic_reactions_114340134  when offering_22275070  any_42344366  new_42141686  food_120429 .
You may need_21177503  to wait_22616113  until your child_19771976  is_22579744  2_42262856  or 3_42262966  years_115004692  old_41703077  to offer_22275070  some_42343988  foods_120429 , or the doctor_19872125  may recommend_2865882  allergy_114340134  testing_1638232 .

Allowing_2793809  a child_19771320  to skip a meal_17470709  is_22579744  a difficult_4782675  concept_15762938  for many_41607490  parents_110244202 , but kids_19771320  should be allowed_2794437  to respond_2709260  to their own_41831352  internal_4988172  cues_15756412  for hunger_113853306  and fullness_114260178 .

On_the_other_hand_3120710 , a child_19771320  shouldn't be allowed_22234353  to eat_21157345  on demand all_42345966  day_114956162  long_3167309 .
During your baby_19682781  first_41050981  3_42262966  months_115007086 , breast_15485384  milk_15334383  or formula_17738920  will continue to provide_21171470  all_42345966  the nutrition_17467715  needed_41638661 .
But as your infant_19682781  develops_2248652  physically and mentally_3230345 , the feeding_11043454  process_11009596  will evolve_2247697 .
In_general_341817 , your child_19771976  will move_22349851  toward consuming_21145724  more_41611077  milk_17737974  during each_42346315  feeding_1826291 , so won't need_21177503  to feed_21168626  as often_359780  and will sleep_214762  longer_3394891  at night_114967986 .
But there will be_22579744  times_17209466  during the next_4145998  year_115004692   and, especially_384750 , in the first_41050981  3_42262966  months_115007086  of life_113775382   when a growth spurt increases_2150700  your baby_19682781  appetite_17383513 .
Continue_22659138  to feed_21167326  on demand and increase_2150700  the number_15061203  of feedings_11043454  as needed_41638661 .

This is_22579744  the time_17209466  when most_41613064  infants_19682781  are introduced to solid_foods_17453329 .

Most_41613064  food_120429  offered_22275070  to your baby_19682781  at this age_114946104  will end_up_2348587  on the baby_19682781  chin_15530121 , bib_12807079 , or highchair_13480292  tray_14422798 .

Fish_17669669  and seafood_17671160 , peanuts_17632056  and peanut_butter_17749365 , and tree nuts are_22579744  also_347757  considered_2682517  allergenic_42696920  for infants_19682781 , and shouldn't be given_22294885  until after the child_19771320  is_22579744  2_42262856  or 3_42262966  years_115004692  old_41703077 , depending_22638691  on whether the child_19771320  is_22579744  at higher_41257379  risk for developing_293465  food_allergies_114339460 .

Your goal_15904683  over the next_4145998  few_41608701  months_115007086  is to introduce_21627743  a wide_4552651  variety_18284231  of foods_120429 .
