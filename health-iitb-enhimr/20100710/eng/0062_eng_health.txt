The probe_13961313  has a small tube at its side, which allows your doctor to take a biopsy of the prostate.
You may feel a sharp, quick jab as the needle passes through the wall of the rectum and into the prostate where a small amount of tissue is extracted.
The pain is minimal and usually subsides by the time the procedure is completed.
As many as six or eight biopsies may be required to optimize the chances of detecting and accurately establishing the stage of a cancer.
It is very common to have some blood in the urine or faeces or sperm at the time of ejaculation.
These symptoms usually subside over time.
You are advised to drink extra fluids for the first one or two days.
After the biopsy, you may experience a burning sensation on urination.
Painkillers, such as Panadol, can ease these discomforts.
You may experience difficulty in urination after the biopsy due to swelling of the prostate gland after the biopsy.
A urinary catheter may be inserted to drain the urine.
If you experience persistent problem in urination, an indwelling catheter is inserted and you will be hospitalized.
It surrounds the urethra at the base of the bladder.
The urethra is the passage that carries urine from the bladder to the end of the penis.
The prostate produces fluid for nourishment of sperms.
The prostate tends to enlarge as a person ages.
This enlargement is usually benign, but malignancy (cancer) can occur.
An enlarged prostate gland tends to narrow the passage of the urethra and obstructs urine flow.
If the obstruction is not relieved, retention of urine results.
This leads to urinary tract infection, bladder stone and sudden inability to pass urine.
This inability to pass urine is a painful condition that requires a doctor to insert a rubber tube (catheter) into the bladder.
You will need to be hospitalized to relieve the blockage of the bladder by surgery.
You may be having an enlarged prostate if you are experiencing difficulty passing urine, incomplete bladder emptying, dribbling, and frequent urination especially during the night.
See a doctor if the symptoms persist or worsen.
There are medications available to relieve these symptoms but they do not necessarily prevent your prostate problem from getting worse.
As urine flows through the urethra is reduced, greater pressure is required to empty the bladder.
This will eventually lead to an overstretched bladder, kidney failure, and acute retention of urine.
Transurethral resection of the prostate (TURP) is done with a specially designed instrument that is passed through the urethra.
There is no incision on the skin.
During the surgery, part of the enlarged prostate will be removed.
This is like removing the flesh of the orange.
Like the orange peel, the capsule of the prostate will remain after the surgery.
Thus, the operation does not remove the entire prostate but enough tissue to provide a good channel for the passage of urine.
The operation takes less than one hour.
Erection is not affected but there will be less fluid ejaculated.
This is because the spermatic fluid goes into your bladder due to the large channel created.
Spinal anaesthesia is used for the surgery.
During a TURP, the enlarged prostate is scraped to increase the size of the channel.
You will feel no pain during the procedure.
Even after the anaesthesia wears off the discomfort is very minimal.
A large catheter is inserted into the bladder after the surgery to prevent blood clots from forming in the bladder.
Pieces of prostate tissues are flushed out.
Your urologist will explain to you the need for TURP and the potential complications of the procedure.
Inform the doctor if you have any drug allergies or if you are taking aspirin and other blood thinning agents.
Bring along all prescriptions and overthecounter medicines you are presently taking.
Remember to bring along your Admission Form given to you during the preadmission session at the Specialist Clinic.
Below is the treatment plan for you if you are admitted for TURP.
At the Specialist Clinic Your doctor will ask you for your medical history and explain to you the nature of your operation as well as its complications.
Blood may be taken from you for tests to ensure that you are in good health and fit for the surgery.
The nurse will check your weight, temperature, pulse, respiration rate and blood pressure.
Your doctor will ask for your medical history and examine you.
He / she will again explain to you the nature of your operation, its complications and obtain your consent for the operation.
The anaesthetist will assess your fitness for surgery.
Blood may be taken (if this has not been done in the clinic) to ensure that you are fit for surgery.
The operating theatre nurse will check your name and particulars.
Some men may experience urinary frequency, urgency and incontinence but this will settle by the third month after surgery.
Avoid lifting heavy things or exertion for 3  to 4  weeks because excessive force can cause bleeding.
If there is blood in your urine, lie down and relax.
Drink 1  to 2  glasses of fluid as soon as possible.
The next time you pass your urine, the bleeding should have stopped.
Call your urologist or come to the emergency department if the bleeding continues.
You may experience frequent urination, urgency and incontinence.
You should abstain from sexual activity for one month after the surgery.
Eat lots of fruits and high fibre food to avoid constipation.
Take laxatives if you still do not move your bowels after 3  days.
If you were taking aspirin before the operation, you can resume it after a week, provided your urine is not heavily bloodstained.
There is no known way to prevent an enlarged prostate as it is part of the process of aging.
Any operation or anaesthetic carries a risk.
However, the gains from a TURP exceed the risks.
If you have had significant illness or medical problems in the past, your risk will be higher and your doctor may discuss alternative treatment for your prostate problem.
The syndrome is caused by the absorption of the irrigation fluid into the body.
The symptoms of TUR syndrome include mental confusion, nausea, vomiting, high blood pressure, slow heartbeat and visual disturbances.
TUR syndrome is treated with medication that removes this excess water from the body.
Incontinence due to damage to the external sphincter (the muscle to keep your urethra closed) is rare.
It is more commonly due to a preexistent overactive bladder.
Your doctor will prescribe medication if this bladder condition is present.
Recurrence is possible and is due to re growth of the prostate gland.
An enlarged prostate is usually a benign condition and does not lead to cancer.
The prostate tissue that is removed is always checked for cancer.
