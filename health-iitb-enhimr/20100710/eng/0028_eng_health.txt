Thus the capacity_113598414  of the lungs_15322893  increases_2153864 .
This can be noted_22098934  by measuring_2639347  the chest_15483589  after breathing in and out.
After doing_21697549  exercises_1619029  the girth of the chest_15483589  gradually_3108993  increases_2153864  following inspiration_1824721  (breathing_in_25041 ).
We have_22182934  a good check fatigue to guide us.
It works_22501264  as a safety valve, as a limit_113577172  to exercise_1619029 .
We should gauge_2664380  the amount_132028  of exercise_1619029  that we should do_21697549 , for better_4251307  results_111246064 .
Beyond that we begin to feel_22086634  fatigue_113830227 .
When we run_21908395  or do_21697549  exercise_1619029  the breath_114646273  becomes_2147020  deeper_4728408 .
There is_22579744  frequent_41107882  bringing_in_22062220  of more_41611077  oxygen_114454163  into the lungs_15322893  that gets_2147020  absorbed into the blood_15335196 .
Carbon_dioxide_114602409  from the blood_15335196  gets_2147020  eliminated_272257  into the air_114645770  while we breathe_out_24227 .
This increase_113573168  in breath_114646273  is called_21018451  "second_wind_14781554 ".
Even_317488  after we stop_22655013  doing_21697549  exercises_1619029 , the heart_15324154  continues_22659138  to beat_21862510  faster_387206  and we still_332017  
keep_22659138  on breathing_21740  heavily_3511931  till the three_42262966  worst_4250656  toxins_114836246  are eliminated_272257 .
This is_22579744  known_as_42511488  acute_4841460  fatigue_113830227  and is_22579744  quite_319418  uncomfortable_4502545  for the body_15154650 .
The general_41478509  fatigue_113830227  will pass_off_2417391  in a few_41608701  hours_115028658  or after a night_114967986  sleep_113838748 .
Your capacity_15141907  and skills_15567929  increase_2153864 .
The level_16164929  of training_1881267  can be gauged_2664380  by measuring_2639347  the oxygen_114454163  consumed_4964828  and the accumulated_4565769  lactic_acid_114732345 .
A simple_42251527  method_15590135  has been devised_21617930 .
An efficient_4878282  circulation_111274325  of blood_15335196  in a trained_41980315  person_17626  is characterised_2946993  by a slow_41020319  rise_1360349  in the pulse_rate_115080034  during exercise_1619029  and a prompt_4879191  return_17345402  to the resting_21532857  condition_113735349  after exercise_1619029 .
The pulse_rate_115080034  during severe_42400509  exercise_1619029  goes_up_2152403  to 140_42273390 /mt.
In five_42263136  minutes_115035576  after stopping_22655013  the exercises_1619029 , it should come_22661019  to normal_41652138 .
The pulse_rate_115080034  is also_347757  affected_219468  by emotion_17377995 .
This is_22579744  a very_332750  simple_42251527  test_1992713  and can be used_21147708  easily_3149063  by any_42344366  person_17626 .
The test_1992713  of physical_fitness_114353750  is_22579744  a sure_42544360   pointer  to cardiovascular_42959016  fitness_114353750 .
Among older_41703749  people_17834515 , the effect_111246064  of training_1881267  can likewise_3138871  be demonstrated_2656725 .
A tense_42486449  relationship_113599759  can tire_274290  you faster_387206 .
Agility_14945145 , endurance_14973557 , flexibility_14963530  and strength_14970691  are_22579744  the test_1992713  of fitness_114353750 .
A combination_17855596  of qualities_15776237  that enables_2507708  a person_17626  to perform_21697549  well_311118  in vigorous_4914182  physical_41840808  activities_1403481  leads_22610448  to physical_fitness_114353750 .
Healthy_41216552  people_17834515  may be_22579744  physically unfit_41058270  because they do not_324548  exercise_298726  regularly_3196547 .
Good_health_113863489  and physical_fitness_114353750  are_22579744  the same_42139473 .
Individuals_17626  who are_22579744  physically fit_41057629  tend_22695145  to be_22579744  more_3100048  slender_41030784  and develop_293465  greater_41439123  resistance_114334507  to disease_113883821  and recover_291852  faster_387206  if they do become_2147020  ill_42624970 .

Physical_fitness_114353750  is_22579744  a personal_41829957  responsibility_114322921 .
Most_41613064  people_17834515  are_22579744   physically  unfit_41058270  because they simply_34956  do not_324548  get sufficient_42414842  exercise_1619029 .
The years_115004692  between adolescence_114948783  and middle_age_114954414  are_22579744  the peak_41550390  period_114914858  for physical_fitness_114353750 .
Habits_1410053  that aid_22523332  physical_fitness_114353750  include_22607558  getting_22190280  enough_42415123  sleep_113838748 , eating_1826291  properly_3197726 , receiving_22189688  regular_42447431  medical_42845379  and dental_42797455  care_1648004 , and maintaining_22655994  personal_41829957  cleanliness_14840972 .
Health_114256157  can be harmed by overeating_1747901  or eating_1826291  the wrong_4154395  kinds_15766180  of food_120429 , smoking_1822551 , drug_abuse_1934019  and excessive_41589076  alcohol_17777863 .
Fitness_114353750  during childhood_114948030  influences_22512310  fitness_114353750  in an adult_19469104 .
Nobody_19776889  seems_22113647  to give_22294885  a thought_15700135  to his/her health_114256157 .
Push_22383350  yourself, discipline_22529407  yourself to do_21697549  exercises_1619029  every_42346474  day_114956162  for just_34711  one_42262724  month_115007086  and then_3119164  you will get_2147020  into the habit_1410053 .
It must become_2147020  a second_nature_1410614  to you.
Then_3119164  all_42345966  the doors_15119817  of happiness_113801340  will open_2534708 , you will live_22589864  and enjoy_21803158  every_42346474  moment_115047665  of it.
The history_114922667  of exercise_1619029  goes_back_22699624  to thousands_113569755  of years_115043767 .
An ancient_41704353  book_16325082  called_42511627  "Mallayudha" mentions_21014090  the scope_15065140  of exercise_1619029  and refers_21014090  to the cure_14028651  by manipulation_1138071  if something_12929  goes_wrong_22504178  while doing_21697549  strenuous_4913995  exercises_1619029 .
Believers_19703097  of the Indian_43012740  system_15591863  of exercise_1619029  like wrestling_1616557 , Dand Baithak, Mugdar, etc._3104379  find courage_14801792  from Hanuman_19389694  and they pray_2751461  to him for strength_14976345 .
"Cong Fou" of ancient_41704353  China_18600800  was_22579744  a series_18342833  of ritualistic_43191107  postures_15020713  and motions_16783937  prescribed_2738660  by priests_110314619  for relief_1351073  of pain_15654390  and other_42140352  symptoms_114108771  of ailments_113869195 .
Ancient_41790574  Greeks_19570081  had_22182934  their God_19368661  of Health_114256157  ("Aesculapius_19422584 ").
There were_22579744 , in_fact_3150075 ,  temples_14355393  of health_114256157 .
The entire_4541797  nation_18056156  including_22607558  their Kings_110078740 , used_22347413  to worship_21761986  at these temples_14355393  and keep_22655994  their bodies_15154650  fit_41057629 , trim_41031230  and beautiful_475211 .
Hippocrates_110888937 , the father_19957085  of modern_41590811  medicine_1606716 , said_2999158  "the wasting_114174408  of the fleshy_42815348  parts_113628130 " is_22579744  the greatest_41439123  in those cases_17208756  in which the patient_110250423  keeps_22655994  the limb_15490999  up_397040  and does not_324548  exercise_299556  it.
Those who practice_22537019  walking_1279775  have_22182934  the least_41612005  atrophy_114174408 .
Frequent_41107882  and rapid_41019557  walks_1279775  were recommended_2865882  by him to reduce_2424760  obesity_14941838 .
He ordered_2738243  a cautious_4348117  approach_1927464  when resuming_2346133  strenuous_4913995  exercises_1619029  after prolonged_41491533  rest_115073413 .
Primitive_4856328  people_17834515  practiced_22537019  it.
In modern_times_114921883  we have come_back_2949812  to the idea_15761049  of early_4851244  ambulating_21893778  and postpartum_4147517  exercises_1619029  to strengthen_2217868  the abdominal_wall_15534938 .
Russian_43041301  author_110632698 , S P Bodkin, advocated_2865882  breathing_1819106  exercises_1619029  for those who have suffered_264897  a heart_attack_113925149  so that they will not_324548  feel_22086634  short_42415934  of breath_1822947  on slight_41610698  exertion_1615918 .
Facilitation_111289107  has been instituted_21632463  as an adjutant to strengthen_2217868  weakened_42405328  muscles_15225981  particularly_384750  in hemiplegics_110019209 .
They are_22579744  useful_42579357  for regaining_22226903  control_1818363  of 
voluntary_muscles_15227821 .
People_17834515  know_2587430  how you look_233090 , and you know_2587430  how you feel_22086634 .
By exercising_298726 , your appearance_14618853  will improve_2202077 , your sagging_42485227  abdomen_15487753  will sink_21967606  in and your muscles_15225981  will bulge_2259906 .
Your personality_14562609  and gait_1282704  will improve_2202077 .
There will be_22579744  lightness_14945145  in your step_1281764 .
You will feel_21754776  like a new_42141686 , youthful_41709530  person_17626 .
A person_17626  has_22182934  a pulse_rate_115080034  of 72_42269606  beats_17299976  per minute_115035576 .
If you take_22575056  a short_41494564  run_1290123  or do_21697549  vigorous_4914182  exercise_1619029  you will feel_22086634  short_42415934  of breath_1822947 , and may not_324548  be_22579744  able_41740  to run_21908395  longer_3394891 .
The pulse_17299976  at this stage_115089620  may reach_21988529  140_42273390 /mt.
If you exercise_298726  regularly_3196547  the pulse_rate_115080034  will gradually_3108993  come_down_21952509 .
In a week_114970832 , a month_115007086 , 3_42262966  months_115007086 , one_42262724  year_115004692  you will note_22098934  a marked_41336010  reduction_1347827  of pulse_rate_115080034  at rest_113826367 .
If you take_22575056  a run_1290123  or do_21697549  vigorous_4914182  exercises_1619029  you will be_22579744  able_41740  to run_21908395  a longer_41486034  distance_15025048  or do_21697549  exercise_1619029  for a longer_41490468  time_17209466  before becoming_2147020  breathless_4290452 .
This means_2945436  that now you are_22579744  capable_4328551  of putting_in_22684213  more_41612299  hours_114919747  of work_1570312  without getting_2147020  tired_274290 .
You will not_324548  feel_22086634  fagged_out_42515664  or exhausted_41130883  at the end_115066306  of the day_114965916 .
Still_332017  a lot_113593557  of energy_113863939  will be_22579744  in reserve_113195795  for you to enjoy_21803158  life_113775382 , since you have become_2147020  more_3100048  vibrant_42357623 , energetic_4912371  and ready_42000491  to suck_21526192  the honey_17752595  of life_15738819 .
Most_41613064  heart_attacks_113925149  and strokes_113895746  come_2337964  during the period_114914858  of emotional_43066342  stress_114218562 .
This may coincide_2341344  with a set_back_17373920  in business_11080062  or even_317488  while watching_22131231  a  tense   world cup .
During stress_114184686 , a hormone_15342374 , called_42511627  adrenalin_15343679 , is secreted_268517  into the blood_15335196 .
Due_to_4192257  it, the pulse_rate_115080034  rises_2152403 , blood_pressure_111265269  shoots_up_2428079 , blood_15335196  becomes_2147020  more_3100048  viscous_42497911  and blood_sugar_114687745  rises_2152403 .
If you have been exercising_298726  regularly_3196547 , you can cope up with all_42345966  these stress_114218562  signals_16700319 .
Exercising_299556  the heart_15324154  can help_22711571  you to cope up with emergencies_17316426  much_359483  better_359914 .
The coronary_artery_15279412  of the heart_muscles_15325288  has_22182934  many_41607490   branches  which are linked_21342435  profusely_3216124  by capillaries_15359966 .
During an emergency_17316426  as the pulse_115080034  rises_2428739 , more_41611077  blood_15335196  is pumped_22333736 , all_42345966  the capillaries_15359966  open_up_21334696  and so there is_22579744  no_42345165  chance_114291269  that the heart_15324154  will have_22182934  a lesser_41611360  oxygen_114454163  supply_113596369  leading_22610448  to its failure_113873266 .
The capillaries_15359966  open_up_21334696  and the blood_pressure_111265269  will not_324548  shoot_up_2428079  high_3359103 .
When you exercise_298726  the sugar_114598144  in the blood_15335196  is burnt_up_21193716  and you are equipped_41136203  better_4251307  to cope up with such an emergency_17316426 .
Even_318086  if the coronary_artery_15279412  of such a person_17626  is blocked_21465161  by floating_482406  fat, the heart_15324154  will not_324548  be affected_219468  by lack_114257672  of oxygen_114454163 .
This is_22579744  possible_41886604  because of a profuse_415817  branching out of coronary_arteries_15279412  and plenty_113593557  of blood_15335196  supply_113596369  through the capillaries_15359966  in the heart_15324154  wall_15534758 .
Enough_42415123  supply_113596369  of oxygen_114454163  will be maintained_22655994  and the heart_15324154  will not_324548  be infracted.
When you fill_up_2447583  the petrol_114493143  tank_14336799  of a car_12929975 , it overflows_22053835  when full_41124846 .
If you eat_21157345  2 ,800  calories_113546016  every_42346474  day_114956162  and use_21147708  only_34711  2 ,400  calories_113546016  in routine_41735790  work_1570312 , 400_42274780  calories_113546016  left_4965460  will be stored_22259548 .
When you keep_22659138  on storing_22259548  what is_22579744  left out, the unused_41702717  energy_113863939 , you start_2341793  gaining_245606  weight_14967979 .
